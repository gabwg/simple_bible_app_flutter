     Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need,
     as some do,
     letters of recommendation to you, or from you?
    </span>

     You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our
     hearts, to be known and read by all.

     And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of
     the living God, not on
     tablets of stone but on
     tablets of
     human hearts.

     Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.

     <sup class="versenum">

     Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but
     our sufficiency is from God,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-3-6" id="en-ESV-28831">
     <sup class="versenum">

     who has made us sufficient to be
     ministers of
     a new covenant, not of
     the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but
     the Spirit gives life.

     Now if
     the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory
     that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-3-8" id="en-ESV-28833">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8

     will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-3-9" id="en-ESV-28834">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     For if there was glory in
     the ministry of condemnation,
     the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-3-10" id="en-ESV-28835">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-3-11" id="en-ESV-28836">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11

     For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.

     Since we have such a hope,
     we are very bold,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-3-13" id="en-ESV-28838">
     <sup class="versenum">

     not like Moses,
     who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-3-14" id="en-ESV-28839">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14
     </sup>
     But
     their minds were
     hardened. For to this day,
     when they read
     the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-3-15" id="en-ESV-28840">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts.

    <span class="text 2Cor-3-16" id="en-ESV-28841">
     <sup class="versenum">
      16

     But when
     one
     turns to the Lord,
     the veil is removed.

     Now the Lord
     is the Spirit, and where
     the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
     freedom.

     And we all, with unveiled face,
     beholding
     the glory of the Lord,
     are being transformed into the same image
     from one degree of glory to another.
     For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.
