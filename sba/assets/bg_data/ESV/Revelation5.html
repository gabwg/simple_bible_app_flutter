     Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne
     a scroll written within and on the back,
     sealed with seven seals.

     And
     I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”

     And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold,
     the Lion
     of the tribe of Judah,
     the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”

     And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw
     a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with
     seven eyes, which are
     the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.

     And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders
     fell down before the Lamb,
     each holding a harp, and
     golden bowls full of incense,
     which are the prayers of the saints.
