     Now Elisha had said to the woman
     whose son he had restored to life, “Arise, and depart with your household, and sojourn wherever you can, for the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.

     And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to appeal to the king for her house and her land.

     And while he was telling the king how
     Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”

     And Hazael said, “Why does my lord weep?” He answered, “Because I know
     the evil that you will do to the people of Israel. You will set on fire their fortresses, and you will kill their young men with the sword
     and dash in pieces their little ones and rip open their pregnant women.”

     “The
