     The ark of the

     was in the country of the Philistines seven months.

     And the Philistines called for the priests and
     the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     ? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place.”

     They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him
     a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why
     his hand does not turn away from you.”

     And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?” They answered, “Five golden
     tumors and five golden mice,
     according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords.

     So you must make images of your
     tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land,
     and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps
     he will lighten his hand from off you
     and your gods and your land.

     Why should you harden your hearts as
     the Egyptians and
     Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them,
     did they not send the people away, and they departed?

     Now then, take and prepare
     a new cart and two milk cows
     on which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them.

     and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side
     the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as
     a guilt offering. Then send it off and let it go its way

     and watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land, to
     Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it is not
     his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence.”

     And the cows went straight in the direction of
     Beth-shemesh along
     one highway, lowing as they went. They turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of
     Beth-shemesh.

     The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there.
     A great stone was there. And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the
