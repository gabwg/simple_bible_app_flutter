     Lawsuits Against Believers

     When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous
     instead of the saints?

     Or do you not know that
     the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?

     Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life!

     So if you have such cases,
     why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church?

     I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers,

     To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you.
     Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?

     Or do you not know that the unrighteous
     will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived:
     neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,

     such were some of you. But
     you were washed,
     you were sanctified,
     you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
