     Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of
     bronze.

     The first chariot had

     the third
     white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong.

     Then I answered and said to
     the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”

     And the angel answered and said to me,
     “These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after
     presenting themselves before
     the Lord of all the earth.

     The chariot with the black horses goes toward
     the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward
     the south country.”

     When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and
     patrol the earth. And he said, “Go,
     patrol the earth.”
     So they patrolled the earth.

     the north country have set my Spirit at rest in
     the north country.”
