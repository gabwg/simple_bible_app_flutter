     Now the men of Israel had sworn
     at Mizpah, “No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin.”

     And the people came to
     Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.

     , the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?”

     And the next day the people rose early and

     And the people of Israel said, “Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the

     For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the

      Lord
     </span>
     to Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”

     And the people of Israel
     had compassion for Benjamin their brother and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel this day.

     What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the

     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     to Mizpah?” And behold, no one had come to the camp from
     Jabesh-gilead, to the assembly.

     For when the people were mustered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of

     So the congregation sent 12,000 of their bravest men there and commanded them,

     This is what you shall do:

     And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him, and they brought them to the camp at
     Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.

     Then the whole congregation sent word to the people of Benjamin who were at the

     And Benjamin returned at that time. And they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead, but they were not enough for them.

     Then the elders of the congregation said,
     “What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?”

     and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to
     dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.

     And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us, because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.’”

     And the people of Benjamin did so and took their wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance
     and rebuilt the towns and lived in them.

     And the people of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
