     The Priestly Order of Melchizedek

     For this
     Melchizedek, king of
     Salem, priest of
     the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
    </span>
    <span class="text Heb-7-2" id="en-ESV-30050">

     and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.

     He is without father or mother
     or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.

    <span class="text Heb-7-4" id="en-ESV-30052">

     See how great this man was to whom Abraham
     the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils!

     And
     those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers,
     though these also are descended from Abraham.
    </span>
    <span class="text Heb-7-6" id="en-ESV-30054">

     But this man
     who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed
     him who had the promises.

    <span class="text Heb-7-7" id="en-ESV-30055">

     It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.

     In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one
     of whom it is testified that
     he lives.

     One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,

     Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?
    </span>
    <span class="text Heb-7-12" id="en-ESV-30060">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.

     For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.

     <sup class="versenum">

     For it is evident that our Lord was descended
     from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.

     This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,

     the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand,
     a better hope is introduced, through which

     For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest,
     holy, innocent, unstained,
     separated from sinners, and
     exalted above the heavens.

     He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily,
     first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this
     once for all when he offered up himself.

     For the law appoints men
     in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made
     perfect forever.
