     Then I looked, and behold, on
     Mount Zion
     stood the Lamb, and with him
     144,000 who
     had his name and his Father's name written
     on their foreheads.

     And I heard a voice from heaven
     like the roar of many waters and
     like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of
     harpists playing on their harps,

     and they were singing
     a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders.
     No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.

     It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for
     they are virgins. It is these
     who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as
     firstfruits for God and the Lamb,

     Then I saw another angel
     flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to
     those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.

     the wine of God's wrath,
     poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and
