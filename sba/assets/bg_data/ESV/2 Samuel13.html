     Amnon and Tamar

     Now
     Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was
     Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David's son, loved her.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-2" id="en-ESV-8320">

     </sup>
     And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-3" id="en-ESV-8321">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
     Shimeah, David's brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-4" id="en-ESV-8322">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     And he said to him, “O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.”
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-5" id="en-ESV-8323">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.’”
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-6" id="en-ESV-8324">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and
     make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-7" id="en-ESV-8325">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7
     </sup>
     Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him.”
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-8" id="en-ESV-8326">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-9" id="en-ESV-8327">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said,
     “Send out everyone from me.” So everyone went out from him.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-10" id="en-ESV-8328">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

     But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”
    </span>

     She answered him, “No, my brother, do not violate
     me, for
     such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this
     outrageous thing.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-13" id="en-ESV-8331">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13
     </sup>
     As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of
     the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-14" id="en-ESV-8332">

     But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.

    <span class="text 2Sam-13-15" id="en-ESV-8333">
     <sup class="versenum">
      15
     </sup>
     Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Get up! Go!”
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-16" id="en-ESV-8334">
     <sup class="versenum">
      16

     But she said to him, “No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me.”
     But he would not listen to her.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-17" id="en-ESV-8335">

     He called the young man who served him and said, “Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.”

     <sup class="versenum">
      18

     Now she was wearing
     a long robe with sleeves,
     for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Sam-13-19" id="en-ESV-8337">

     And Tamar
     put ashes on her head and
     tore the long robe that she wore. And
     she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.
    </span>

     And her brother Absalom said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart.” So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house.

     When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.

     neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.

     After two full years Absalom had
     sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.

     Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, “Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar.
