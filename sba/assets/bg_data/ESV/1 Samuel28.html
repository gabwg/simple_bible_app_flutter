     In those days
     the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, “Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army.”

     David said to Achish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”

     Now
     Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him
     in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put
     the mediums and the necromancers out of the land.

     The Philistines assembled and came and encamped
     at Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped
     at Gilboa.

     When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.

     the

     Then Saul said to his servants,
     “Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “Behold, there is a medium at

     So Saul
     disguised himself and put on other garments and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night. And he said,
     “Divine for me by a spirit and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you.”

     The woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done,

     “As the

     He said to her, “What is his appearance?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped

     Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and
     God has turned away from me and
     answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do.”
