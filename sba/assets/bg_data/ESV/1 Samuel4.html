     Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines. They encamped at
     Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at
     Aphek.

     The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle.

     And when the people came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the

     defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the
