     In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign.

     Ahaz was
     twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the

     but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel.
     He even burned his son as an offering,
     according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     drove out before the people of Israel.

     Then Rezin king of Syria and
     Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to wage war on Jerusalem, and they besieged Ahaz
     but could not conquer him.

     At that time Rezin the king of Syria recovered
     Elath for Syria and drove the men of Judah from
     Elath, and the Edomites came to Elath, where they dwell to this day.

     So Ahaz sent messengers to
     Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.”

     Ahaz also

     And the king of Assyria listened to him. The king of Assyria marched up against Damascus
     and took it, carrying its people captive to
     Kir, and he killed Rezin.

     When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet
     Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, he saw the altar that was at Damascus. And King Ahaz sent to
     Uriah the priest a model of the altar, and its pattern, exact in all its details.

     the bronze altar that was before the

     And King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn
     the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering and the king's burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering and their drink offering. And throw on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice, but
     the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”
