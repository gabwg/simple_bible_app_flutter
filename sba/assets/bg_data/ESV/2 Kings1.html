     Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, “Go, inquire of
     Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron,
     whether I shall recover from this sickness.”

     You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’” So Elijah went.
