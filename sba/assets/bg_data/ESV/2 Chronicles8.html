     Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the

     According to the ruling of David his father, he appointed
     the divisions of the priests for their service,
     and the Levites for their offices of praise and
     ministry before the priests
     as the duty of each day required, and
     the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate, for so David
     the man of God had commanded.

     And Hiram sent to him by the hand of his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon and brought from there
