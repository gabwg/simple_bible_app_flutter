     They
     set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.

     And the whole congregation of the people of Israel

     said to Moses, “Behold, I am about to rain

     Then Moses

     In the evening

     When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another,

     But when they measured it with an omer,
     whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat.
