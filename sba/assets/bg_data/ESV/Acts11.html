     Now the apostles and
     the brothers
     who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.

     So when Peter went up to Jerusalem,
     the circumcision party
     criticized him, saying,

     But Peter began and explained it to them in order:

     “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.

     God gave
     the same gift to them as he gave to us

     repentance that leads to life.”
