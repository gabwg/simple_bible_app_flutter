     From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between
     Kadesh and Shur; and he
     sojourned in
     Gerar.

     And Abraham said of Sarah his wife,
     “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.

     But God came to Abimelech
     in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife.”

     Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said,
     “Lord, will you kill an innocent people?

     Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”

     Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning
     against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.

     Now then, return the man's wife,
     for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you

     Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.”
