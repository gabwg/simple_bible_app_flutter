     And David said, “I will deal loyally
     with Hanun the son of
     Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the Ammonites.

     But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it?”

     So Hanun took David's servants and shaved off half the beard of each and cut off their garments in the middle,

     When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of
     Beth-rehob, and
     the Syrians of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of
     Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of

     And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate, and

     When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.
