     Then Solomon began to build the house of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     in Jerusalem
     on Mount Moriah, where the

      Lord

     had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed,
     on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

     He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.

     These are Solomon's
     measurements
     for building the house of God:
     the length, in cubits
     of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.

     The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house,
     and its height was 120 cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.

     The nave he lined with cypress and covered it with fine gold
     and made palms and chains on it.

     So he lined the house with gold—its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors—
     and he carved cherubim on the walls.
