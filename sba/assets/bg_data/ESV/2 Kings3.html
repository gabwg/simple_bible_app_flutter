     In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twelve years.

     that his father had made.

     Nevertheless, he clung to
     the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
     which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it.

     Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder,
     and he had to deliver to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams.

     But

     So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.

     And he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to battle against Moab?” And he said, “I will go.
     I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”

     So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and
     the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.

     “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here,
