     After some days, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with
     a young goat. And he said, “I will go in to my wife in the chamber.” But her father would not allow him to go in.

     And her father said, “I really thought that you utterly hated her,
     so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.”

     And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards.

     Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” And they said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife
     and given her to his companion.” And the Philistines came up and
     burned her and her father with fire.

     Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that
     the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so have I done to them.”
