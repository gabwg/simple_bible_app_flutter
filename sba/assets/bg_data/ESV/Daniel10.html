     In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel,
     who was named Belteshazzar. And
     the word was true, and it was a great conflict.
     And
     he understood the word and
     had understanding of the vision.

     In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for
     three weeks.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-3" id="en-ESV-22019">
     <sup class="versenum">

     I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I
     anoint myself at all, for
     the full three weeks.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-4" id="en-ESV-22020">

     On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing
     on the bank of the great river (
     that is, the Tigris)
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-5" id="en-ESV-22021">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold,
     a man clothed in linen,
     with a belt of fine
     gold from Uphaz around his waist.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-6" id="en-ESV-22022">

     His body was like
     beryl, his face
     like the appearance of lightning,
     his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and
     legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and
     the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-7" id="en-ESV-22023">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-8" id="en-ESV-22024">

     So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and
     no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed,
     and I retained no strength.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-9" id="en-ESV-22025">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Then I heard the sound of his words,
     and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep
     with my face to the ground.
    </span>

   <p>
    <span class="text Dan-10-10" id="en-ESV-22026">

     And behold,
     a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.

     And he said to me, “O Daniel,
     man greatly loved,
     understand the words that I speak to you, and
     stand upright, for
     now I have been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.

    <span class="text Dan-10-12" id="en-ESV-22028">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Then he said to me,
     “Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you
     set your heart to understand and
     humbled yourself before your God,
     your words have been heard,
     and I have come because of your words.

     The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me
     twenty-one days, but
     Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia,
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-14" id="en-ESV-22030">
     <sup class="versenum">

     and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people
     in the latter days. For
     the vision is for days yet to come.”

     When he had spoken to me according to these words,
     I turned my face toward the ground
     and was mute.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-16" id="en-ESV-22032">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And behold,
     one in the likeness of the children of man
     touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, “O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and
     I retain no strength.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-10-17" id="en-ESV-22033">

     How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.”

     Again
     one having the appearance of a man
     touched me and strengthened me.

     <sup class="versenum">

     And he said,
     “O man greatly loved,
     fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.” And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”

     <sup class="versenum">

     Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the
     prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of
     Greece will come.

     But I will tell you
     what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except
     Michael, your prince.
