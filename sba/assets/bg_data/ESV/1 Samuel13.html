     Saul lived for one year and then became king, and when he had reigned for two years over Israel,

     Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in
     Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in
     Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent.

     like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of
