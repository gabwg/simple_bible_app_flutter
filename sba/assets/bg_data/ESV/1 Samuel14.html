     Within
     the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

     So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming
