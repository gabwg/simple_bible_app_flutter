     Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.

     The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.

     Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mistreat me.” But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.

     And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army
