     Now Ahab had seventy sons in
     Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of the city,
     to the elders, and to
     the guardians of the sons
     of Ahab, saying,

     “Now then, as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and weapons,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Kgs-10-3" id="en-ESV-9797">

     But they were exceedingly afraid and said, “Behold, the two kings could not stand before him. How then can we stand?”

    <span class="text 2Kgs-10-5" id="en-ESV-9799">
     <sup class="versenum">

     So he who was over the palace, and he who was over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, sent to Jehu, saying,
     “We are your servants, and we will do all that you tell us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your eyes.”

     Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time.” Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city,
     who were bringing them up.

     And as soon as the letter came to them, they took the king's sons
     and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.

     When the messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king's sons,” he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.”

     Then in the morning, when he went out, he stood and said to all the people, “You are innocent.

     So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his great men and his close friends and his priests, until he left him none remaining.

     Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,

     Jehu met
     the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, “Who are you?” And they answered, “We are the relatives of Ahaziah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother.”
    </span>

     He said, “Take them alive.” And they took them alive and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons, and he spared none of them.

     And when he departed from there, he met
     Jehonadab the son of
     Rechab coming to meet him. And he greeted him and said to him, “Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?” And Jehonadab answered, “It is.” Jehu said,
     “If it is,
     give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand. And Jehu took him up with him into the chariot.

     And when he came to Samaria,

     Now therefore call to me all the
