     Guard your steps when you go to
     the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to
     offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.

     Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore
     let your words be few.

     For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with
     many words.

     When
     you vow a vow to God,
     do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools.
     Pay what you vow.

     It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.

     Let not your mouth lead you
     into sin, and do not say before
     the messenger
     that it was
     a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?

     God is the one you must fear.

     If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness,
     do not be amazed at the matter,
     for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.
