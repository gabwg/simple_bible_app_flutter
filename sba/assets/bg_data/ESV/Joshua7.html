     But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for
     Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the

     Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near
     Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.

     So about three thousand men went up there from the people. And

     why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!

     Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They
