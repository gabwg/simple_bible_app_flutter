     In the days
     when the judges ruled there was
     a famine in the land, and a man of
     Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.

     The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were
     Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there.

     These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years,

     Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that
