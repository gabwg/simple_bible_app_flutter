     And there was a man in
     Maon whose business was in
     Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats.
     He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

     And David said to his men, “Every man strap on his sword!” And every man of them strapped on his sword. David also strapped on his sword. And
     about four hundred men went up after David,
     while two hundred
     remained with the baggage.

     Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs
