     Now
     the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     said
     to Abram, “Go from your country
     and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.

    <span class="text Gen-12-2" id="en-ESV-301">

     And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.

    <span class="text Gen-12-3" id="en-ESV-302">
     <sup class="versenum">

     I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and

     So Abram went, as the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from
     Haran.

    <span class="text Gen-12-5" id="en-ESV-304">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,

    <span class="text Gen-12-6" id="en-ESV-305">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     Abram
     passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to
     the oak
     of
     Moreh. At that time
     the Canaanites were in the land.

    <span class="text Gen-12-7" id="en-ESV-306">

     Then the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     appeared to Abram and said,
     “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , who had appeared to him.

    <span class="text Gen-12-8" id="en-ESV-307">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8

     From there he moved to the hill country on the east of
     Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     and called upon the name of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     Now
     there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.

     When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance,

     And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.

     But the

     afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.

     So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?

     And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.
