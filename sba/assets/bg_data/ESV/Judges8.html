     Then the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they accused him fiercely.

     And he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not
     the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?

     God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?”
     Then their anger
     against him subsided when he said this.

     And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and
     the 300 men who were with him, exhausted yet pursuing.

     So he said to the men of
     Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”

    <span class="text Judg-8-6" id="en-ESV-6726">

     So Gideon said, “Well then, when the

     And from there he went up to
     Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.

     Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of
     the people of the East, for there had fallen 120,000 men
     who drew the sword.

     And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers east of
     Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the army, for the army felt
     secure.

     And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them
     and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic.

     And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men.

     And he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying,
     ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?’”

     And he took the elders of the city, and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson.

     Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “Where are the men whom you killed at
     Tabor?” They answered, “As you are, so were they. Every one of them resembled the son of a king.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Judg-8-19" id="en-ESV-6739">
     <sup class="versenum">

     As the

     So he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise and kill them!” But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a young man.

     Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength.” And Gideon arose and
     killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took
     the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.

     <sup class="versenum">

     And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels

     the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels.

     And Gideon
     made an ephod of it and put it in his city,
     in Ophrah. And all Israel
     whored after it there, and it became a
     snare to Gideon and to his family.
