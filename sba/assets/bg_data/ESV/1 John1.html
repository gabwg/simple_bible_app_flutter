     That which was
     from the beginning,
     which we have heard,
     which we have seen with our eyes,
     which we looked upon and
     have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—

     the life
     was made manifest, and we have seen it, and
     testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life,
     which was with the Father and
     was made manifest to us—

     that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed
     our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
