     No man has power to

     Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of
     the holy place and were
     praised
     in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.

     There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people
     to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people
     to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.

     then I saw all the work of God, that
     man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know,
     he cannot find it out.
