     When the Lamb opened
     the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.

     Then I saw the seven angels
     who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

     And another angel came and stood
     at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with
     the prayers of all the saints on
     the golden altar before the throne,

     the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.

     Then the angel took the censer and
     filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and
     there were peals of
     thunder, rumblings,
     flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.

     The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed
     hail and
