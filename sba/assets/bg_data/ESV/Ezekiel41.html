     Then he brought me to
     the nave and measured the
     jambs. On each side six cubits
     was the breadth of the jambs.

     And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. And he measured the length of the nave,
     forty cubits, and its breadth,
     twenty cubits.

     Then he went
     into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls on either side
     of the entrance, seven cubits.

     And he measured
     the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, across
     the nave. And he said to me, “This is
     the Most Holy Place.”

     Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick, and the breadth of
     the side chambers, four cubits,
     all around the temple.

     And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another,
     thirty in each story. There were offsets
     all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers,
     so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple.

     And it became broader as it wound upward to the side chambers, because the temple was enclosed upward all around the temple. Thus the temple had a broad area upward, and
     so one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story.

     I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of
     six long cubits.

     And the doors of the
     side chambers opened on
     the free space, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the free space was five cubits all around.
