     And I saw a beast rising out of the sea,
     with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and
     blasphemous names on its heads.

     And the beast that I saw was
     like a leopard; its feet were like
     a bear's, and its mouth was like
     a lion's mouth. And to it
     the dragon gave his power and
     his throne and great authority.

     One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and
     the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.

     And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying,
     “Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”

     And the beast was given
     a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for
     forty-two months.

     It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling,
     that is, those who dwell in heaven.

     Also it was allowed
     to make war on the saints and to conquer them.
     And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation,

     Then
     I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.

     the beast
     it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast
     that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.

     worship the image of the beast
     to be slain.
