     Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and
     Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian,
     had bought him from the
     Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.

     His master saw that the

     was with him and that the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.

     So Joseph
     found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house
     and put him in charge of all that he had.

     From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     blessed the Egyptian's house
     for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the

     So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge, and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate.

     But he refused and said to his master's wife, “Behold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and

     He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and

     would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.

     she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.
