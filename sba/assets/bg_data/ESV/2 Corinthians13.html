     This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established
     by the evidence of two or three witnesses.

     I warned
     those who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that
     if I come again I will not spare them—

     since you seek proof that Christ
     is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but
     is powerful among you.

     For
     he was crucified in weakness, but
     lives by the power of God. For
     we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you
     we will live with him by the power of God.

     Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith.
     Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that
     Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test!

     For this reason I write these things while I am away from you, that when I come
     I may not have to be
     severe in my use of
     the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
