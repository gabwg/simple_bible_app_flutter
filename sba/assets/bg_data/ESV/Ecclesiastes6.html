     There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:

    <span class="text Eccl-6-2" id="en-ESV-17420">
     <sup class="versenum">
      2
     </sup>
     a man
     to whom
     God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he
     lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God
     does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity;
     it is a grievous evil.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-6-3" id="en-ESV-17421">

     If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that
     the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's
     good things, and he also has no
     burial, I say that
     a stillborn child is better off than he.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-6-4" id="en-ESV-17422">

     For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.

     Moreover, it has not
     seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds
     rest rather than he.

     Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy
     no goodâ€”do not all go to the one place?

     All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-6-8" id="en-ESV-17426">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For what advantage has the wise man
     over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-6-9" id="en-ESV-17427">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Better
     is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is
     vanity and a striving after wind.

     Whatever has come to be has
     already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to
     dispute with one stronger than he.

     The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?

     For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his
     vain
     life, which he passes like
     a shadow? For who can tell man what will be
     after him under the sun?
