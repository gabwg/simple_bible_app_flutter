     And when it was decided
     that
     we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan
     Cohort named Julius.

     And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by
     Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.

     We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.

     Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even

     And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.
