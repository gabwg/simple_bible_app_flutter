     For this reason I, Paul,
     a prisoner of Christ Jesus
     on behalf of you Gentiles—
    </span>
    <span class="text Eph-3-2" id="en-ESV-29237">
     <sup class="versenum">
      2

     assuming that you have heard of
     the stewardship of
     God's grace that was given to me for you,
    </span>
    <span class="text Eph-3-3" id="en-ESV-29238">
     <sup class="versenum">

     how the mystery was made known to me
     by revelation,
     as I have written briefly.

     When you read this, you can perceive my insight into
     the mystery of Christ,

    <span class="text Eph-3-5" id="en-ESV-29240">
     <sup class="versenum">

     which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.

     This mystery is
     that the Gentiles are
     fellow heirs,
     members of the same body, and
     partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
    </span>

     Of this gospel I was made
     a minister according to the gift of
     God's grace, which was given me
     by the working of his power.

     To me,
     though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given,
     to preach to the Gentiles the
     unsearchable
     riches of Christ,

    <span class="text Eph-3-9" id="en-ESV-29244">
     <sup class="versenum">

     and
     to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery
     hidden for ages in
     God,
     who created all things,
    </span>
    <span class="text Eph-3-10" id="en-ESV-29245">
     <sup class="versenum">

     so that through the church the manifold
     wisdom of God
     might now be made known to
     the rulers and authorities
     in the heavenly places.

     This was
     according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord,
