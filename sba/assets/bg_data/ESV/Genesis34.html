     Now
     Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land.

     Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her.

     The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and
