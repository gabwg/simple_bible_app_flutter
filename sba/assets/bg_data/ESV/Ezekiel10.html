     Then I looked, and behold,
     on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something
     like a sapphire,
     in appearance like a throne.

     And he said to
     the man clothed in linen, “Go in among
     the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with
     burning coals from between the cherubim, and
     scatter them over the city.”

     Now the cherubim were standing
     on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and
     a cloud filled
     the inner court.

     was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with
     the brightness of the glory of the

     And
     the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court,
     like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.

     And when he commanded

     “Take fire from between

     And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.

     And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub, and
     the appearance of the wheels was
     like sparkling
     beryl.

     When they went, they went in any of their four directions
     without turning as they went,

     faced, the others followed without turning as they went.

     the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was
     a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
