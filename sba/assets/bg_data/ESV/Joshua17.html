     Then allotment was made to the people of Manasseh, for he was
     the firstborn of Joseph. To
     Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead,
     were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war.

     They approached
     Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said,

     Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. These cities, to the south of the brook, among the cities of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea,
