     Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him,
     “There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.

     but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms,
     and it was like a daughter to him.

     Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”

     Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan,
     “As the

     to do what is evil in his sight?

     On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.”
