     And
     the angel who talked with me came again
     and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep.

     And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold,
     a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and
     seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.

     Zerubbabel:
     Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the
