     Again
     there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , and Satan also came among them to present himself before the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     And the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Satan answered the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Job-2-3" id="en-ESV-12895">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     And the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still
     holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him
     without reason.”

    <span class="text Job-2-4" id="en-ESV-12896">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     Then Satan answered the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     and said, “Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.

     But
     stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will
     curse you to your face.”

    <span class="text Job-2-6" id="en-ESV-12898">

     And the

     </span>
     said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.”

    <span class="text Job-2-7" id="en-ESV-12899">

     So Satan went out from the presence of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     and struck Job with loathsome
     sores from
     the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

     And he took
     a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in
     the ashes.

    <span class="text Job-2-9" id="en-ESV-12901">

     Then his wife said to him, “Do you still
     hold fast your integrity?
     Curse God and die.”

     But he said to her, “You speak as one of the
     foolish women would speak.
     Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?”
     In all this Job did not
     sin with his lips.

     Now when Job's three
     friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz
     the Temanite, Bildad
     the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to
     show him sympathy and comfort him.

     And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they
     tore their robes and sprinkled
     dust on their heads toward heaven.

     And they sat with him on the ground
     seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.
