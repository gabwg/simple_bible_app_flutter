     Now
     the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See, the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us.

     Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there.” And he answered, “Go.”

     So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.

     Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place,
     he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.

     Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”

     So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.

     When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”

     open his eyes that he may see.” So the

     open the eyes of these men, that they may see.” So the

     He answered, “You shall not strike them down. Would you strike down those whom you have taken captive

     Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.”

     And there was a great famine in Samaria, as they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab
