     And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
     But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.

     And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king
     sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have brought good to you.

     And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan. Saul swore,

     Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, “If you do not escape with your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”

     Michal took

     Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go.

     Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at
     Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth.

     Then Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them,
     the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul,
     and they also prophesied.

     Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” And one said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in

     And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.

     And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night. Thus it is said,
     “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
