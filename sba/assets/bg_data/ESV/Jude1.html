     Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our
     common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you
     to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.

     For
     certain people
     have crept in unnoticed
     who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert
     the grace of our God into sensuality and
     deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

     Now I want
     to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that
     Jesus, who saved
     a people out of the land of Egypt,

     the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day—

     just as
     Sodom and Gomorrah and
     the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and
     pursued unnatural desire,
     serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.

     Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and
