     Submission to the Authorities

     Let every person
     be subject to the governing authorities. For
     there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.

     Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.

     For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you
     will receive his approval,

     for
     he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God,
     an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.

     Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also
     for the sake of conscience.

     For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.

     For the commandments,
     “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word:
     “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
