     Then he brought me back to
     the door of the temple, and behold,
     water was issuing from below
     the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of
     the altar.

     Then he brought me out by way of
     the north gate and led me around on the outside to
     the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side.

     Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand,
     the man measured a thousand cubits,
     and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep.

     Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.

     And he said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into
     the Arabah, and enters the sea;
     when the water flows into
     the sea, the water will become fresh.

     And wherever the river goes,
     every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea
     may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.

     Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From
     Engedi to
     Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of
     the Great Sea.

     And on the banks,
     on both sides of the river, there will grow
     all kinds of trees for food.
     Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail,
     but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and
     their leaves for healing.”
