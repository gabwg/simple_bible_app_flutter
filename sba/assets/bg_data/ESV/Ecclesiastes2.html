     The Vanity of Self-Indulgence
    </span>
   </h3>
   <p class="chapter-1">
    <span class="text Eccl-2-1">

     </span>
     I
     said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But behold, this also was vanity.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-2" id="en-ESV-17336">
     <sup class="versenum">
      2
     </sup>
     I
     said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of pleasure, “What use is it?”
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-3" id="en-ESV-17337">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     I
     searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine—my heart still guiding me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on
     folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-4" id="en-ESV-17338">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     I made great works. I
     built houses and planted
     vineyards for myself.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-5" id="en-ESV-17339">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     I made myself
     gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-6" id="en-ESV-17340">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-7" id="en-ESV-17341">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7
     </sup>
     I bought male and female slaves, and had
     slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of
     herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-8" id="en-ESV-17342">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     I also gathered for myself silver and
     gold and the treasure of
     kings and
     provinces. I got
     singers, both men and women, and many
     concubines,
     the delight of the sons of man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-9" id="en-ESV-17343">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     So I became great and
     surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my
     wisdom remained with me.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-10" id="en-ESV-17344">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart
     found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my
     reward for all my toil.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-11" id="en-ESV-17345">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11
     </sup>
     Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was
     vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing
     to be gained under the sun.
    </span>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-12" id="en-ESV-17346">
     The Vanity of Living Wisely
    </span>
   </h3>
   <p>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-12">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     So I turned to consider
     wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only
     what has already been done.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-13" id="en-ESV-17347">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13
     </sup>
     Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-14" id="en-ESV-17348">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14
     </sup>
     The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the
     same event happens to all of them.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-15" id="en-ESV-17349">
     <sup class="versenum">
      15
     </sup>
     Then I said in my heart,
     “What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?” And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-16" id="en-ESV-17350">
     <sup class="versenum">
      16
     </sup>
     For of the wise as of the fool there is
     no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten.
     How the wise dies just like the fool!
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-17" id="en-ESV-17351">
     <sup class="versenum">
      17
     </sup>
     So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for
     all is vanity and a striving after wind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-18" id="en-ESV-17352">
     The Vanity of Toil

   </h3>
   <p>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-18">
     <sup class="versenum">
      18
     </sup>
     I hated
     all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must
     leave it to the man who will come after me,
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-19" id="en-ESV-17353">
     <sup class="versenum">
      19
     </sup>
     and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-20" id="en-ESV-17354">
     <sup class="versenum">
      20
     </sup>
     So I
     turned about and gave my heart up to despair
     over all the toil of my labors under the sun,
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-21" id="en-ESV-17355">
     <sup class="versenum">
      21
     </sup>
     because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-22" id="en-ESV-17356">
     <sup class="versenum">
      22
     </sup>
     What has a man from
     all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-23" id="en-ESV-17357">
     <sup class="versenum">
      23
     </sup>
     For
     all his days are full of sorrow, and his
     work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-24" id="en-ESV-17358">
     <sup class="versenum">
      24
     </sup>
     There is nothing better for a person than that he should
     eat and drink and find enjoyment
     in his toil. This also, I saw, is
     from the hand of God,
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-25" id="en-ESV-17359">
     <sup class="versenum">
      25

     for apart from him
     who can eat or who can have enjoyment?
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-2-26" id="en-ESV-17360">
     <sup class="versenum">
      26
     </sup>
     For to the one who pleases him
     God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given
     the business of gathering and collecting,
     only to give to one who pleases God.
     This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
