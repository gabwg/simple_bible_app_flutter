     After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem
     Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with
     the officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers, and had brought them to Babylon, the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     showed me this vision: behold,
     two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the

     One basket had very good figs,
     like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had
     very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.

     said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”

     Then the word of the

     I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land.
     I will build them up, and not tear them down;
     I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
