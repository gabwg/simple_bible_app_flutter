     But I, brothers,
     could not address you as

     people of the flesh, as
     infants in Christ.

     I fed you with milk, not solid food, for

     for you are still of the flesh. For while there is
     jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?

     According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled
