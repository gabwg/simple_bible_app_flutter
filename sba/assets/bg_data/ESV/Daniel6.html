     It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom
     120
     satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom;
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-2" id="en-ESV-21908">

     and over them
     three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these
     satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss.

    <span class="text Dan-6-3" id="en-ESV-21909">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     Then this Daniel became
     distinguished above all
     the other high officials and
     satraps, because
     an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned
     to set him over the whole kingdom.

    <span class="text Dan-6-4" id="en-ESV-21910">

     Then
     the high officials and
     the satraps
     sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom,
     but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful,
     and no error or fault was found in him.

    <span class="text Dan-6-5" id="en-ESV-21911">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”

    <span class="text Dan-6-6" id="en-ESV-21912">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Then these
     high officials and
     satraps came by agreement
     to the king and said to him, “O
     King Darius, live forever!

    <span class="text Dan-6-7" id="en-ESV-21913">

     All the
     high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the
     counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an
     injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-8" id="en-ESV-21914">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     Now, O king, establish
     the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to
     the law of
     the Medes and the Persians,
     which cannot be revoked.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-9" id="en-ESV-21915">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Therefore King Darius signed the document and
     injunction.

     </sup>
     When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where
     he had windows in his upper chamber open
     toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees
     three times a day and prayed and
     gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-11" id="en-ESV-21917">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11

     Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-12" id="en-ESV-21918">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     Then they
     came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, “O king! Did you not sign
     an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered and said, “The thing stands fast, according to the law of
     the Medes and Persians,
     which cannot be revoked.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-13" id="en-ESV-21919">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13
     </sup>
     Then they answered and said before the king,
     “Daniel, who is one
     of the exiles
     from Judah,
     pays no attention to you, O king, or
     the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition
     three times a day.”

   <p>
    <span class="text Dan-6-14" id="en-ESV-21920">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14
     </sup>
     Then
     the king, when he heard these words,
     was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-15" id="en-ESV-21921">
     <sup class="versenum">
      15
     </sup>
     Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no
     injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Dan-6-16" id="en-ESV-21922">
     <sup class="versenum">
      16
     </sup>
     Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared
     to Daniel, “May
     your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!”
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-17" id="en-ESV-21923">
     <sup class="versenum">
      17
     </sup>
     And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den,
     and the king sealed it
     with his own signet and with the signet of his
     lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-18" id="en-ESV-21924">

     Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting;
     no diversions were brought to him, and
     sleep fled from him.

   <p>
    <span class="text Dan-6-19" id="en-ESV-21925">

     Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions.

     <sup class="versenum">

     As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of
     the living God,
     has your God, whom you serve continually,
     been able to deliver you from the lions?”
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-21" id="en-ESV-21927">
     <sup class="versenum">
      21

     Then Daniel said to the king,
     “O king, live forever!

    <span class="text Dan-6-22" id="en-ESV-21928">
     <sup class="versenum">
      22

     My God
     sent his angel
     and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless
     before him;
     and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-23" id="en-ESV-21929">
     <sup class="versenum">
      23

     Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and
     no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-6-24" id="en-ESV-21930">
     <sup class="versenum">
      24

     And the king commanded, and
     those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions—they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.
