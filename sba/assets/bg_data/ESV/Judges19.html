     In those days,
     when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of
     the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from
     Bethlehem in Judah.

     And his concubine was unfaithful to
     him, and she went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months.

     Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house. And when the girl's father saw him, he came with joy to meet him.

     And his father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and spent the night there.

     And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law,
     “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go.”

     let your heart be merry.”

     And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, “Behold, now the day has waned toward evening. Please, spend the night. Behold, the day draws to its close. Lodge here and let your heart be merry, and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go home.”

     But the man would not spend the night. He rose up and departed and arrived opposite
     Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him.

     So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin,

     And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was from

     The men of the place were Benjaminites.
