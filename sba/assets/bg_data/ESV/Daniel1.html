     In the third year of
     the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.

     And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of
     the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to
     the land of Shinar, to the house of his god,
     and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god.

     Then the king commanded Ashpenaz,
     his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family
     and of
     the nobility,

     youths without
     blemish, of good appearance and
     skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king's palace, and to
     teach them the literature and language of the
     Chaldeans.

     The king assigned them a daily portion of
     the food that the king ate, and of
     the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for
     three years, and at the end of that time they were to
     stand before the king.

     Among these were
     Daniel,
     Hananiah,
     Mishael, and
     Azariah of the tribe of Judah.

     And
     the chief of the eunuchs
     gave them names:
     Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.

     But Daniel
     resolved that he would not
     defile himself with
     the king's food, or with
     the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to

     <sup class="versenum">

     and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king.”

     Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat

     So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them
     vegetables.

     As for these four youths,
     God gave them learning and
     skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had
     understanding in all visions and dreams.
