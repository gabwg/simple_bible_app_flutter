     And Joshua the son of Nun
     sent
     two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” And they went and came into the house of
     a prostitute whose name was
     Rahab and lodged there.

     Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.”

     And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.”
