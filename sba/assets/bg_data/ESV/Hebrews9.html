     Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and

     For
     a tent
     was prepared, the first section, in which were
     the lampstand and
     the table and

     It is called the Holy Place.

     These preparations having thus been made,

     the high priest goes, and he but
     once a year, and not without taking blood,

     But when Christ appeared as a high priest
     of the good things that have come,
     then through
     the greater and more perfect tent (

     he
     entered
     once for all into the holy places, not by means of

     how much more will
     the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
     offered himself without blemish to God,
     purify our
     conscience
     from dead works
     to serve the living God.

     Therefore he is
     the mediator of a new covenant, so that
     those who are called may
     receive the promised eternal inheritance,
     since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.

     a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.

     Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated

     For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took
     the blood of calves and goats,
     with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
    </span>
    <span class="text Heb-9-20" id="en-ESV-30109">
     <sup class="versenum">
      20

     “This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.”

    <span class="text Heb-9-21" id="en-ESV-30110">
     <sup class="versenum">
      21

     And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both
     the tent and all the vessels used in worship.

    <span class="text Heb-9-22" id="en-ESV-30111">

     Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and
     without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.

     Thus it was necessary for
     the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.

     For Christ has entered, not into holy places
     made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God
     on our behalf.

     Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as
     the high priest enters
     the holy places every year with blood not his own,

     for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is,
     he has appeared
     once for all
     at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
    </span>

     <sup class="versenum">

     And just as
     it is appointed for man to die once, and
     after that comes judgment,

     so Christ, having been offered once
     to bear the sins of
     many, will appear
     a second time,
     not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly
     waiting for him.
