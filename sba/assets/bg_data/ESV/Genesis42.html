     When
     Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”

    <span class="text Gen-42-2" id="en-ESV-1255">

     And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may
     live and not die.”

    <span class="text Gen-42-3" id="en-ESV-1256">

     So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.

     But Jacob did not send Benjamin,
     Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for
     he feared that harm might happen to him.

    <span class="text Gen-42-5" id="en-ESV-1258">

     Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

     Now Joseph was governor
     over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and
     bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.

     Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and
     spoke roughly to them. “Where do you come from?” he said. They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”

    <span class="text Gen-42-8" id="en-ESV-1261">

     And Joseph
     remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them.
     And he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”

     On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live,

     Then they said to one another,
     “In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.”
