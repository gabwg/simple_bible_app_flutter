     Food Offered to Idols

     Now concerning
     food offered to idols: we know that
     “all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge”
     puffs up,
     but love builds up.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-2" id="en-ESV-28513">

     If anyone imagines that he knows something,
     he does not yet know as he ought to know.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-3" id="en-ESV-28514">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     But if anyone loves God,
     he is known by God.
    </span>
   </p>

    <span class="text 1Cor-8-4" id="en-ESV-28515">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that
     “an idol has no real existence,” and that
     “there is no God but one.”
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-5" id="en-ESV-28516">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For although there may be
     so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”—
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-6" id="en-ESV-28517">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     yet
     for us there is one God, the Father,
     from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and
     one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and
     through whom we exist.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-7" id="en-ESV-28518">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     However, not all possess this knowledge. But some,
     through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and
     their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-8" id="en-ESV-28519">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-9" id="en-ESV-28520">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     But take care
     that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block
     to the weak.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-10" id="en-ESV-28521">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating
     in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged,
     if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-11" id="en-ESV-28522">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11
     </sup>
     And so by your knowledge this weak person is
     destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-12" id="en-ESV-28523">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     Thus, sinning against your brothers
     and
     wounding their conscience when it is weak,
     you sin against Christ.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Cor-8-13" id="en-ESV-28524">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13
     </sup>
     Therefore,
     if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
