     to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and

     For
     we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.

     he saved us,
     not because of works done by us in righteousness, but
     according to his own mercy, by
     the washing of regeneration and

     avoid foolish
