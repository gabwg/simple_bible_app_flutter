     In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at
     Mizpah. As they
     ate bread together there at Mizpah,

     Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him,
     whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land.

     Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at
     Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.

     On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,

     eighty men arrived from
     Shechem and
     Shiloh and
     Samaria, with
     their beards shaved and
     their clothes torn, and
     their bodies gashed,
     bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the

     And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from
     Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”

     When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern.

     But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death, for we have
     stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.

     Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with
     Gedaliah was the large cistern that
     King Asa had made for defense against
     Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.

     Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah,
     the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom
     Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to
     the Ammonites.
