     Now I commend you

     But I want you to understand that
     the head of every man is Christ,
     the head of a wife
     is her husband,
     and
     the head of Christ is God.

     but every wife
     who prays or
     prophesies
     with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same
     as if her head were shaven.

     For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head.

     But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
