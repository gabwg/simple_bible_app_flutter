     There was a man of
     the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

     And he said to his mother, “The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said,
     “Blessed be my son by the

     And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, “I dedicate the silver to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother
     took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah.

     And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made
     an ephod and
     household gods, and
     ordained
     one of his sons, who became his priest.

     Now there was a young man of
     Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

     And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to
     the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
