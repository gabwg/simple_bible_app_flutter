     What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions
     are
     at war within you?

     You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.

     You adulterous people!
     Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?
     Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.

     Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit

     Do not speak evil against one another, brothers.
     The one who speaks against a brother or
     judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
