     Then he commanded
     the steward of his house,
     “Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack,

     They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his
     steward, “Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good?

     Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and
     by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.’”

     They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!

     Behold,
     the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?

     And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out
