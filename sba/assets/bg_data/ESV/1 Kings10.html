     Now when

     Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels
     bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.

     And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.

     And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,

     Then she gave the king 120 talents
     of gold, and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again came such an abundance of spices as these that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
