     And looking intently at the council, Paul said, “Brothers,
     I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.”

     And the high priest

     Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you

     contrary to the law you
     order me to be struck?”

     Now when Paul perceived that one part were
     Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Brothers,
     I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is
     with respect to the
     hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.”

     Then a great clamor arose, and some of

     “We find nothing wrong in this man. What
     if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?”

     And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into
     the barracks.
