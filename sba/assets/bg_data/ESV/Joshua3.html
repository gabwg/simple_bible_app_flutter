     Then Joshua rose early in the morning and they set out
     from Shittim. And they came to the Jordan, he and all the people of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.

     “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the

     the Arabah,
     the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho.
