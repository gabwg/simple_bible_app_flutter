     For you yourselves know, brothers,
     that our
     coming to you
     was not in vain.

     But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated
     at Philippi, as you know,
     we had boldness in our God
     to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much
     conflict.

     For
     our appeal does not spring from
     error or

     but just as we have been approved by God
     to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not
     to please man, but to please God
     who tests our hearts.

     And
     we also thank God constantly
     for this, that when you received
     the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it
     not as the word of men
     but as what it really is, the word of God,
     which is at work in you believers.
