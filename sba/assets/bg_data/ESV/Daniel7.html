     Daniel's Vision of the Four Beasts

     In the first year of
     Belshazzar king of Babylon,
     Daniel saw a dream and
     visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter.

     Daniel declared,
     “I saw in my vision by night, and behold,
     the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-7-3" id="en-ESV-21937">

     And four great beasts
     came up out of the sea, different from one another.

     The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-7-5" id="en-ESV-21939">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And behold,
     another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-7-6" id="en-ESV-21940">
     <sup class="versenum">

     After this I looked, and behold, another, like a
     leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and
     dominion was given to it.

    <span class="text Dan-7-7" id="en-ESV-21941">

     After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast,
     terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth;
     it devoured and broke in pieces
     and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and
     it had ten horns.

     I considered the horns, and behold,
     there came up among them another horn, a little one,
     before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and
     a mouth speaking great things.
