     These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:

     Now there arose a new king over Egypt,

     Therefore they set taskmasters over them

     Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
