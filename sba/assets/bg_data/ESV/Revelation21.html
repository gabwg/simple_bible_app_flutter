     Then I saw
     a new heaven and a new earth, for
     the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.

     new Jerusalem,

     prepared
     as a bride adorned for her husband.

     And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold,
     the dwelling place

     I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
