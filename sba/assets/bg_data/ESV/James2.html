     The Sin of Partiality

     My brothers,
     show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,
     the Lord of glory.

     For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,
    </span>
    <span class="text Jas-2-3" id="en-ESV-30280">
     <sup class="versenum">

     and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,”
     while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”
    </span>
    <span class="text Jas-2-4" id="en-ESV-30281">
     <sup class="versenum">

     have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become
     judges with evil thoughts?

     Listen, my beloved brothers,
     has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be
     rich in faith and heirs of
     the kingdom,
     which he has promised to those who love him?
    </span>
    <span class="text Jas-2-6" id="en-ESV-30283">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     But you
     have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who
     drag you
     into court?
    </span>
    <span class="text Jas-2-7" id="en-ESV-30284">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable
     name by which you were called?

     If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture,
     “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.

     But if you
     show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.

    <span class="text Jas-2-10" id="en-ESV-30287">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point
     has become guilty of all of it.

     <sup class="versenum">

     For he who said,
     “Do not commit adultery,” also said,
     “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.

     So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under
     the law of liberty.

     judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

     What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith

     Rahab the prostitute justified by works
