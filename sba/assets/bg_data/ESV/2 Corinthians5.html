     Our Heavenly Dwelling

     For we know that if
     the tent that is
     our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God,
     a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

     For in this tent
     we groan, longing to
     put on our heavenly dwelling,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-5-3" id="en-ESV-28864">

     we may not be found naked.

     For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdenedâ€”not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal
     may be swallowed up by life.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-5-5" id="en-ESV-28866">

     He who has prepared us for this very thing is God,
     who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.

     So we are always of good courage. We know that
     while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,

    <span class="text 2Cor-5-7" id="en-ESV-28868">
     <sup class="versenum">

     we walk by faith, not
     by sight.

     Yes, we are of good courage, and we
     would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

     please him.

     For
     we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
     so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

     Therefore, knowing

     controls us, because we have concluded this: that

     the message of reconciliation.
