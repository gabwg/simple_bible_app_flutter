     Brothers,
     my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.

     For I bear them witness that
     they have a zeal for God,
     but not according to knowledge.

     For, being ignorant of
     the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.

     But
     the righteousness based on faith says,
     “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)

     because, if

     How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him
     of whom they have never heard?
