     Jesus, High Priest of a Better Covenant

     Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest,
     one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,

    <span class="text Heb-8-2" id="en-ESV-30078">

     a minister in the holy places, in
     the true tent
     that the Lord
     set up, not man.

    <span class="text Heb-8-3" id="en-ESV-30079">

     For
     every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus
     it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.

    <span class="text Heb-8-4" id="en-ESV-30080">

     Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.

     They serve
     a copy and
     shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying,
     “See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”

     But as it is, Christ
     has obtained a ministry that is
     as much more excellent than the old as
     the covenant
     he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.
