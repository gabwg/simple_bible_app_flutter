     In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of
     Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of
     Azzur, the prophet from
     Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the

     Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the

     As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the

     Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of

     Sometime after the prophet
