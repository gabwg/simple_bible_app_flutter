     Count it all joy, my brothers,

    <span class="text Jas-1-3" id="en-ESV-30253">

     for you know that
     the testing of your faith
     produces steadfastness.

    <span class="text Jas-1-4" id="en-ESV-30254">
     <sup class="versenum">

     perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

     If any of you lacks wisdom,
     let him ask God,
     who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.

     let him ask in faith,
     with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like
     a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.

     Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person
