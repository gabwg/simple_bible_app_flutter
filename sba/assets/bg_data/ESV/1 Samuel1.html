     There was a certain man of
     Ramathaim-zophim of
     the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph,
     an Ephrathite.

     He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

     Now this man used to go up
     year by year from his city
     to worship and to sacrifice to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     of hosts
     at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     .

     On the day when Elkanah sacrificed,
     he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.

    <span class="text 1Sam-1-5" id="en-ESV-7218">
     <sup class="versenum">

     But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     had closed her womb.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Sam-1-6" id="en-ESV-7219">

     had closed her womb.

     So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.

     <sup class="versenum">

     And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad?
     Am I not more to you than ten sons?”

     After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of
     the temple of the

     deeply distressed and prayed to the

     And she
     vowed a vow and said, “O

      Lord

     of hosts, if you will indeed
     look on the affliction of your servant and
     remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the

     and no razor shall touch his head.”

     Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Sam-1-14" id="en-ESV-7227">
     <sup class="versenum">

     But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but
     I have been pouring out my soul before the
