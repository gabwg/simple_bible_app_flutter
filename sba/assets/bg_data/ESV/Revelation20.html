     Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven,
     holding in his hand the key to
     the bottomless pit
     and a great chain.

     And he seized
     the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and
     bound him for a thousand years,

     and threw him into
     the pit, and shut it and
     sealed it over him, so that
     he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.

     Then I saw
     thrones, and
     seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw
     the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those
     who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands.
     They came to life and
     reigned with Christ for a thousand years.

     Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such
     the second death has no power, but they will be
     priests of God and of Christ, and they
     will reign with him for a thousand years.
