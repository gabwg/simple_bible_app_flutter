     After the death of Saul, when David had returned
     from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.

     And on the third day, behold,
     a man came from Saul's camp,
     with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David,
     he fell to the ground and paid homage.

     And David said to him,
     “How did it go? Tell me.” And he answered, “The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”

     And the young man who told him said,
     “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.

     So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen.
     And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”
