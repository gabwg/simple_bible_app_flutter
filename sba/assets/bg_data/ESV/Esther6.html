     On that night the king could not sleep. And he gave orders to bring
     the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.

     And it was found written how
     Mordecai had told about
     Bigthana
     and
     Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.

     And the king said, “What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?” The king's young men who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”

     And the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered
     the outer court of the king's palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on
     the gallows
     that he had prepared for him.

     And the king's young men told him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.”

     So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What should be done to the man
     whom the king delights to honor?” And Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?”

     let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn,
     and the horse that the king has ridden, and on whose head
     a royal crown
     is set.

     And let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble officials. Let them dress the man whom the king delights to honor, and let them lead him on the horse through the square of the city,
     proclaiming before him: ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.’”

     Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry; take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits
     at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.”

     And Haman told
     his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him.”
