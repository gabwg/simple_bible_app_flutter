     His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him
     who called us to
     his own glory and excellence,

     by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become
     partakers of the divine nature,
     having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.

     no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God
