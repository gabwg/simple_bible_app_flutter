     Then the word of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     came to Jonah the second time, saying,

     So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     Nineveh was an exceedingly great city,

     Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he called out, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”

     And the people of Nineveh believed God.
     They called for a fast and
     put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.

     The word reached
     the king of Nineveh, and
     he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth,
     and sat in ashes.

    <span class="text Jonah-3-7" id="en-ESV-22566">

     And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh,
     “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor
     beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water,

     When God saw what they did,
     how they turned from their evil way,
     God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.
