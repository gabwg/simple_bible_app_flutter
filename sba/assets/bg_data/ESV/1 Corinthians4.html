     This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and
     stewards of the mysteries of God.

     Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.

     But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.

     For I am not aware of anything against myself,
     but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.

     Therefore
     do not pronounce judgment before the time,
     before the Lord comes,
     who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart.
     Then each one will receive his commendation from God.

     I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers,
     that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may
     be puffed up in favor of one against another.

     For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all,
     like men sentenced to death, because we
