     After this Jesus
     revealed himself
     again to the disciples by
     the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way.

     Simon Peter,
     Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of
     Cana in Galilee,
     the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.

     Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will go with you.” They went out and got into the boat, but
     that night they caught nothing.

     Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples
     did not know that it was Jesus.

     Jesus said to them,

      “Children, do you have any fish?”

     They answered him, “No.”

     He said to them,
     <span class="woj">
      “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”
     </span>
     So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish.

     That disciple
     whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
     he put on his outer garment, for he was
     stripped for work, and
     threw himself into the sea.
    </span>

     The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards
     off.

     When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread.

     So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn.

     Jesus said to them,

      “Come and

     </span>
     Now
     none of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.

     When they had
     finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,
     <span class="woj">
      “Simon,
      son of John,
      do you love me more than these?”
     </span>
     He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him,

     He said to him the third time,

     Peter was grieved because he said to him
     the third time,
     <span class="woj">
      “Do you love me?”
     </span>
     and he said to him, “Lord,
     you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him,

      Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young,
      you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.”

     Peter turned and saw
     the disciple whom Jesus loved following them,
     the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, “Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?”

    <span class="text John-21-21" id="en-ESV-26908">

     Jesus said to him,

     So the saying spread abroad among
     the brothers
     that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but,
     <span class="woj">
      “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?”

     This is the disciple
     who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and
     we know
     that his testimony is true.

     Now
     there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that
     the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
