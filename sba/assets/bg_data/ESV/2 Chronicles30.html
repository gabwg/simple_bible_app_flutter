     Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover
     in the second month—

     <sup class="versenum">

     for they could not keep it
     at that time
     because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem—

     and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly.

     So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel,
     from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the Passover to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, “O people of Israel,
     return to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded

     And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread

     And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month.
     And the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
     so that they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the

     For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves. Therefore the Levites had to slaughter the Passover lamb for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate it to the

     For a majority of the people,
