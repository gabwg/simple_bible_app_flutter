     Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of
     the seven seals, and I heard
     one of the four living creatures say
     with a voice like thunder,
     “Come!”

     And I looked, and behold,
     a white horse! And
     its rider had a bow, and
     a crown was given to him, and he came out
     conquering, and to conquer.

     When he opened the second seal, I heard
     the second living creature say, “Come!”

     And out came another horse,
     bright red. Its rider was permitted
     to take peace from the earth, so that people should slay one another, and he was given a great sword.

     When he opened the third seal, I heard the
     third living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and behold,
     a black horse! And its rider had a pair of scales in his hand.

     And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying,
     “A quart
     of wheat for a denarius,
     and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and
     do not harm the oil and wine!”

     When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
     the fourth living creature say, “Come!”

     And I looked, and behold,
     a pale horse! And its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill
     with sword and with famine and with pestilence and
     by wild beasts of the earth.

     When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under
     the altar
     the souls of those who had been slain
     for the word of God and for
     the witness they had borne.

     They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord,
     holy and true,
     how long
     before you will judge and
     avenge our blood on
     those who dwell on the earth?”

     Then they were each given
     a white robe and
     told to rest a little longer,
     until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers
     should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.

     When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold,
     there was a great earthquake, and
     the sun became black as
     sackcloth, the full moon became like blood,

     and
     the stars of the sky fell to the earth
     as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.

     The sky vanished
     like a scroll that is being rolled up, and
     every mountain and island was removed from its place.

     Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave
     and free,
     hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,

     <sup class="versenum">

     calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of
     him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
