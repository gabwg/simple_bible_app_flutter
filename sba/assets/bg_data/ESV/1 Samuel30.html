     Now when David and his men came to
     Ziklag on the third day,
     the Amalekites had
     made a raid against the Negeb and against Ziklag. They had overcome Ziklag and burned it with fire

     who were in it, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off and went their way.

     And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke
     of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul,
     each for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the
