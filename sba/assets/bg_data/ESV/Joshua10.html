     As soon as Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction,
     doing to Ai and its king
     as he had done to Jericho and its king, and
     how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,

    <span class="text Josh-10-5" id="en-ESV-6070">

     Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon,
     gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.
