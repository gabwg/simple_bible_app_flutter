     When the rule of Rehoboam was established
     and he was strong,
     he abandoned the law of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , and all Israel with him.

     In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     ,
     Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-3" id="en-ESV-11441">
     <sup class="versenum">

     with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt—
     Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-4" id="en-ESV-11442">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     And he took
     the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.

    <span class="text 2Chr-12-5" id="en-ESV-11443">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     Then
     Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     ,
     ‘You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.’”
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-6" id="en-ESV-11444">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     Then the princes of
     Israel and the king humbled themselves and said,
     “The
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     is righteous.”
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-7" id="en-ESV-11445">

     </sup>
     When the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     came to Shemaiah:
     “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance,
     and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-8" id="en-ESV-11446">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him,
     that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”

   <p>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-9" id="en-ESV-11447">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     and the treasures of the king's house. He took away everything. He also took away
     the shields of gold that Solomon had made,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-10" id="en-ESV-11448">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10

     and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-11" id="en-ESV-11449">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And as often as the king went into the house of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-12" id="en-ESV-11450">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     And when
     he humbled himself the wrath of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction. Moreover,
     conditions were good
     in Judah.

    <span class="text 2Chr-12-13" id="en-ESV-11451">
     <sup class="versenum">

     So King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.

    <span class="text 2Chr-12-14" id="en-ESV-11452">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And he did evil,
     for he did not set his heart to seek the

      Lord

     .

    <span class="text 2Chr-12-15" id="en-ESV-11453">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Now the acts of Rehoboam,
     from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of
     Shemaiah the prophet and of
     Iddo
     the seer?
     There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Chr-12-16" id="en-ESV-11454">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and
     Abijah
     his son reigned in his place.
