     But all this I laid to heart, examining it all,
     how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are
     in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.

     It is the same for all, since
     the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil,
     to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who
     swears is as he who shuns an oath.

     This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that
     the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and
     madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

     the memory of them is forgotten.

     Again I saw that under the sun
     the race is not to the swift, nor
     the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and
     chance
     happen to them all.

     For man
     does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and
