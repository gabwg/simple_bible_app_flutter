     Released from the Law

     Or do you not know, brothers
     —for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives?
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-2" id="en-ESV-28078">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For
     a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-3" id="en-ESV-28079">

     Accordingly,
     she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.

     Likewise, my brothers,
     you also have died
     to the law
     through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead,
     in order that we may bear fruit for God.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-5" id="en-ESV-28081">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work
     in our members
     to bear fruit for death.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-6" id="en-ESV-28082">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the
     new way of
     the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.

   <h3>
    <span class="text Rom-7-7" id="en-ESV-28083">
     The Law and Sin

     What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law,
     I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if
     the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-8" id="en-ESV-28084">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     But sin,
     seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness.
     For apart from the law, sin lies dead.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-9" id="en-ESV-28085">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-10" id="en-ESV-28086">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     The very commandment
     that promised life proved to be death to me.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-11" id="en-ESV-28087">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11
     </sup>
     For sin,
     seizing an opportunity through the commandment,
     deceived me and through it killed me.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-12" id="en-ESV-28088">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12

     So
     the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.

    <span class="text Rom-7-13" id="en-ESV-28089">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13
     </sup>
     Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-14" id="en-ESV-28090">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14

     For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh,
     sold under sin.

    <span class="text Rom-7-15" id="en-ESV-28091">
     <sup class="versenum">
      15

     For I do not understand my own actions. For
     I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.

    <span class="text Rom-7-16" id="en-ESV-28092">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with
     the law, that it is good.

    <span class="text Rom-7-17" id="en-ESV-28093">
     <sup class="versenum">

     So now
     it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.

    <span class="text Rom-7-18" id="en-ESV-28094">
     <sup class="versenum">
      18
     </sup>
     For I know that nothing good dwells
     in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-19" id="en-ESV-28095">
     <sup class="versenum">
      19

     <sup class="versenum">

     So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.

     <sup class="versenum">

     For
     I delight in the law of God,

    <span class="text Rom-7-23" id="en-ESV-28099">
     <sup class="versenum">
      23
     </sup>
     but I see in my members
     another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-7-24" id="en-ESV-28100">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from
     this body of death?

     Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.
