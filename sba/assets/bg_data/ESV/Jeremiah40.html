     The word that came to Jeremiah from the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     </span>
     after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from
     Ramah, when he took him
     bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.

     The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him,
     “The

     your God pronounced this disaster against this place.

     has brought it about, and has done as he said.
     Because you sinned against the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     </span>
     and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you.

     Now, behold, I release you today from
     the chains on your hands.
     If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well,
     but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come.
     See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go.

     If you remain,
     then return to
     Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan,
     whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go.

     When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that
     the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of

     they went to Gedaliah at
     Mizpah—
     Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
     Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite,
     Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.

     Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon,
     and it shall be well with you.

     As for me, I will dwell at
     Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you,
     gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”

     Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in
     Moab and among
     the Ammonites and in
     Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them,

     then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they
     gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.

     Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered,
     and the remnant of Judah would perish?”
