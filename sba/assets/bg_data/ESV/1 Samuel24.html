     When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.”

     Then Saul took
     three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats' Rocks.

     And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in
     to relieve himself.
     Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts
     of the cave.

     And the men of David said to him,
     “Here is the day of which the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     said to you, ‘Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.’” Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's robe.

     And afterward
     David's heart struck him, because he had cut off a corner of Saul's robe.

     He said to his men,
     “The

     forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the

     's anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is
     the

     So David persuaded his men with these words
     and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.

     Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage.

     gave you today into my hand in the cave.
     And some told me to kill you, but I spared you.
     I said, ‘I will not put out my hand against my lord,
     for he is the

     See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that
     there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though
     you hunt my life to take it.

     As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said,
