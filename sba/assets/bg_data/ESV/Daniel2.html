     In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams;
     his spirit was troubled, and
     his sleep left him.

     Then the king commanded that
     the magicians,
     the enchanters, the
     sorcerers, and
     the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and
     stood before the king.

     the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic,
     “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”

     torn limb from limb,
     and your
     houses shall be laid in ruins.

     there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till

     The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or
     Chaldean.
