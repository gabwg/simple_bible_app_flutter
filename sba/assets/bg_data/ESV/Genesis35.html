     God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to
     Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you
     when you fled from your brother Esau.”

     So Jacob said to his
     household and to all who were with him, “Put away
     the foreign gods that are among you and
     purify yourselves and change your garments.

     Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God
     who answers me in the day of my distress and
     has been with me wherever I have gone.”
