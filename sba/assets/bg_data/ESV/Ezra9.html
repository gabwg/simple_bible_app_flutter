     After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, “The people of Israel and the priests and the
     Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands
     with their abominations, from the
     Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

     For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the
     holy race
     has
     mixed itself with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost.”

     As soon as I heard this, I
     tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and
     sat appalled.

     Then all who
     trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered around me while I sat
     appalled until the evening sacrifice.

     And at the
     evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garment
     and my cloak torn, and fell upon my knees
     and spread out my hands to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   <p>
    <span class="text Ezra-9-6">
     “O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities
     have risen higher than our heads, and our
     guilt has
     mounted up to the heavens.

     From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great
     guilt. And for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering,
     and to utter shame, as it is today.

     our God, to leave us a
     remnant and to give us a

     within his holy place, that our God may
     brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery.

     For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery,
     but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection
     in Judea and Jerusalem.

     which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land that you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land impure with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with
     their uncleanness.
