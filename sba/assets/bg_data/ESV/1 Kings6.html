     In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month,
     he began to build the house of the

     The house that King Solomon built for the

     The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house.

     He also built a structure
     against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and
     the inner sanctuary. And he made
     side chambers all around.

     The lowest story
     was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.
