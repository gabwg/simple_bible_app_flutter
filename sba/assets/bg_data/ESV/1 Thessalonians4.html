     Finally, then, brothers,
     we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you
     received from us
     how you ought to walk and
     to please God, just as you are doing, that you
     do so more and more.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-2" id="en-ESV-29589">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     For
     you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-3" id="en-ESV-29590">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     For this is the will of God,
     your sanctification:
     that you abstain from sexual immorality;
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-4" id="en-ESV-29591">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4

     that each one of you know how to control his own
     body
     in holiness and
     honor,
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-5" id="en-ESV-29592">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     not in
     the passion of lust
     like the Gentiles
     who do not know God;
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-6" id="en-ESV-29593">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     that no one transgress and
     wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is
     an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-7" id="en-ESV-29594">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7

     For
     God has not called us for
     impurity, but in holiness.

     whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God,
     who gives his Holy Spirit to you.

     Now concerning
     brotherly love
     you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been
     taught by God
     to love one another,
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-10" id="en-ESV-29597">
     <sup class="versenum">

     for that indeed is what
     you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to
     do this more and more,
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-11" id="en-ESV-29598">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11

     and to aspire
     to live quietly, and
     to mind your own affairs, and
     to work with your hands, as we instructed you,
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-12" id="en-ESV-29599">
     <sup class="versenum">

     walk properly before
     outsiders and be dependent on no one.

     But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep,
     that you may not grieve as others do
     who have no hope.

     For
     since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him
     those who have fallen asleep.

     For this we declare to you
     by a word from the Lord,
     that
     we who are alive, who are left until
     the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
    </span>

     For
     the Lord himself will descend
     from heaven
     with a cry of command, with the voice of
     an archangel, and
     with the sound of the trumpet of God. And
     the dead in Christ will rise first.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Thess-4-17" id="en-ESV-29604">
     <sup class="versenum">
      17

     Then we who are alive, who are left, will be
     caught up together with them
     in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so
     we will always be with the Lord.

     Therefore encourage one another with these words.
