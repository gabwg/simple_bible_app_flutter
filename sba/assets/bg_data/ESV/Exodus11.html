     The
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     said to Moses, “Yet
     one plague more I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here.
     When he lets you go, he will drive you away completely.

     Speak now in the hearing of the people, that

     And the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.

     So Moses said, “Thus says the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     :
     ‘About midnight I will go out in the midst of Egypt,

     and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is
     behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the cattle.

     There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever will be again.

     But not a dog shall growl

     makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.’

     And

     hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go out of his land.
