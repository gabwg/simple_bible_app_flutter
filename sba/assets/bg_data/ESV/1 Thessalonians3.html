     Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing
     to be left behind at Athens alone,

     and we
     sent Timothy,
     our brother and God's coworker
     in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you in your faith,

     that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that
     we are destined for this.

     For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction,
     just as it has come to pass, and just as you know.

     For this reason,
     when I could bear it no longer,
     I sent to learn about your faith,
     for fear that somehow
     the tempter had tempted you and
     our labor would be in vain.

     But
     now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of
     your faith and love and reported
