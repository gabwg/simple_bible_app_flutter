     Daniel's Vision of the Ram and the Goat
    </span>
   </h3>

     </span>
     In the third year of the reign of
     King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel,
     after that which appeared to me
     at the first.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-2" id="en-ESV-21964">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in
     Susa the citadel, which is in the province of
     Elam. And
     I saw in the vision,
     and I was at the
     Ulai canal.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-3" id="en-ESV-21965">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     I raised my eyes and saw, and behold,
     a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-4" id="en-ESV-21966">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     I saw
     the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No
     beast
     could stand before him,
     and there was no one who could rescue from his power.
     He did as he pleased and
     became great.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Dan-8-5" id="en-ESV-21967">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     As I was considering, behold, a
     male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had
     a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-6" id="en-ESV-21968">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     He came to
     the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal,
     and he ran at him in his powerful wrath.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-7" id="en-ESV-21969">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7
     </sup>
     I saw him come close to the ram,
     and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns.
     And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he
     cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-8" id="en-ESV-21970">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     Then
     the goat
     became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four
     conspicuous horns toward
     the four winds of heaven.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Dan-8-9" id="en-ESV-21971">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     Out of one of them came
     a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward
     the south, toward the east, and toward
     the glorious land.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-10" id="en-ESV-21972">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     It grew great,
     even to the host of heaven. And some of the host
     and some
     of
     the stars it threw down to the ground and
     trampled on them.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-11" id="en-ESV-21973">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11
     </sup>
     It became great, even as great as
     the Prince of the host.
     And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-12" id="en-ESV-21974">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression,
     and it will throw truth to the ground, and
     it will act and prosper.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-13" id="en-ESV-21975">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13
     </sup>
     Then I heard
     a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke,
     “For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering,
     the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?”
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-14" id="en-ESV-21976">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14
     </sup>
     And he said to me,
     “For 2,300
     evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.”

     When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I
     sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having
     the appearance of a man.
    </span>
    <span class="text Dan-8-16" id="en-ESV-21978">
     <sup class="versenum">
      16

     And I heard a man's voice
     between the banks of the
     Ulai, and it called,
     “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”

     So he came near where I stood. And when he came,
     I was frightened
     and fell on my face. But he said to me, “Understand,
     O son of man, that the vision is for
     the time of the end.”

    <span class="text Dan-8-18" id="en-ESV-21980">

     And when he had spoken to me,
     I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But
     he touched me and made me stand up.

     He said, “Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of
     the indignation, for it refers to
     the appointed time of the end.

     As for
     the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of
     Media and Persia.

     And
     the goat
     is the king of Greece. And
     the great horn between his eyes is
     the first king.

     As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his
     nation,
     but not with his power.

     His power shall be great—
     but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction
     and shall succeed in what he does,
     and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints.

     By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind
     he shall become great.
     Without warning he shall destroy many. And he
     shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken—but
     by no human hand.

     The vision of
     the evenings and the mornings that has been told
     is true, but
     seal up the vision,
     for it refers to many days from now.”

     And
     I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king's business, but I was appalled by the vision
     and did not understand it.
