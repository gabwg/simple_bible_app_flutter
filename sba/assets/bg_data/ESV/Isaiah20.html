     In the year that
     the commander in chief, who was sent by Sargon the king of Assyria, came to
     Ashdod and fought against it and captured it—

     at that time the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loose the sackcloth from your waist and take off your sandals from your feet,” and he did so, walking
     naked and barefoot.
