     For I made up my mind
     not to make another painful visit to you.

     For
     if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?

     And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice,
     for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.

     I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.

     Now
     if anyone has caused pain,
     he has caused it not to me, but
     in some measure—not to put it too severely—to all of you.
