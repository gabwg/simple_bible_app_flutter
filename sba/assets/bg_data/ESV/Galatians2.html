     Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.

     I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those
     who seemed influential) the gospel that
     I proclaim among the Gentiles,
     in order to make sure I was not running or had not
     run in vain.

     But even Titus, who was with me,
     was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.

     Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in—who
     slipped in to spy out
     our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus,
     so that they might bring us into slavery—

     the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.

     And from those
     who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me;
     God shows no partiality)—those, I say, who seemed influential
     added nothing to me.

     On the contrary, when they saw that I had been
     entrusted with
     the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised

     and when James and Cephas and John,
     who seemed to be
     pillars, perceived the
     grace that was given to me, they
     gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.

     But
     when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him

     he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing
     the circumcision party.

     But when I saw that their
     conduct was not in step with
     the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas
     before them all, “If you, though a Jew,
     live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”

     yet we know that
     a person is not justified
     by works of the law
     but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law,
