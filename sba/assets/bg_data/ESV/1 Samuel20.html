     Then David fled from Naioth
     in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”

     And he said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. And why should my father hide this from me? It is not so.”

     But David vowed again, saying, “Your father knows well that
     I have found favor in your eyes, and he thinks, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But truly,
     as the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     lives and
     as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.”

     David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is
     the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go,
     that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening.

     If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to run
     to Bethlehem his city, for there is a yearly
     sacrifice there for all the clan.’
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Sam-20-7" id="en-ESV-7738">

     If he says, ‘Good!’ it will be well with your servant, but if he is angry, then know that
     harm is determined by him.

     Therefore deal kindly with your servant,
     for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”

     do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety.
     May the

     On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain beside the stone heap.

     The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite,

     Jonathan answered Saul,

     He said, ‘Let me go, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away and see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king's table.”

     Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
