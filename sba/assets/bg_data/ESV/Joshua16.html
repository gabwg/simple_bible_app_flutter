     The allotment of the people of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho,
     into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel.

     going from Bethel to Luz, it passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites.

     Then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of Lower

     The territory of the people of Ephraim by their clans was as follows: the boundary of their inheritance on the east was
     Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon,

     Michmethath. Then on the east the boundary turns around toward Taanath-shiloh and passes along beyond it on the east to Janoah,
