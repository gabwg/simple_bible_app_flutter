     Then
     the people of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.

     And
     Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

     And
     Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were many. Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel.

     And Moab said to
     the elders of Midian, “This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” So Balak the son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,

    <span class="text Num-22-5" id="en-ESV-4381">
     <sup class="versenum">

     sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor
     at Pethor, which is near the River
     in the land of the people of Amaw,
     to call him, saying, “Behold, a people has come out of Egypt. They cover the face of the earth, and they are dwelling opposite me.

     Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”

    <span class="text Num-22-7" id="en-ESV-4383">

     So the elders of Moab and
     the elders of Midian departed with
     the fees for divination in their hand. And they came to Balaam and gave him Balak's message.
