     Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     in the presence of Eli.
     And the word of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.

     At that time Eli,
     whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place.

     The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down
     in the temple of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , where the ark of God was.

     Then the

     called Samuel, and he said, “Here I am!”

     and ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down.

     called again, “Samuel!” and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.”

     Now Samuel did not yet know the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     , and the word of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     had not yet been revealed to him.

     And the

      Lord

     called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     was calling the boy.

     Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak,
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , for your servant hears.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

     And the

     came and stood, calling as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant hears.”

     Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
