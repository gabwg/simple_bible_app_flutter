     Then
     one of the seven angels who had
     the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of
     the great prostitute
     who is seated on many waters,
    </span>
    <span class="text Rev-17-2" id="en-ESV-30962">

     with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and
     with the wine of whose sexual immorality
     the dwellers on earth have become drunk.”

     And
     he carried me away in the Spirit
     into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on
     a scarlet beast that was full of
     blasphemous names, and
     it had seven heads and ten horns.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rev-17-4" id="en-ESV-30964">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     The woman
     was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned
     with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand
     a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.

    <span class="text Rev-17-5" id="en-ESV-30965">

     And on her forehead was written a name of
     mystery:
     “Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth's abominations.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Rev-17-6" id="en-ESV-30966">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     And I saw the woman, drunk
     with the blood of the saints, the blood of
     the martyrs of Jesus.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Rev-17-6">
     When I saw her, I marveled greatly.

     But the angel said to me, “Why do you marvel? I will tell you
     the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.

     The beast that you saw
     was, and is not, and
     is about to rise from
     the bottomless pit
     and
     go to destruction. And
     the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in
     the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because
     it was and is not and is to come.

     This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated;

     they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while.

     As for the beast
     that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.

     And
     the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings
     for one hour, together with the beast.

     These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.

     They
     will make war on the Lamb, and
     the Lamb will conquer them, for he is
     Lord of lords and
     King of kings, and those with him are
     called and chosen and faithful.”

     And the angel
     said to me,
     “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.

     And
     the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast
     will hate the prostitute. They will make her
     desolate and
     naked, and
     devour her flesh and
     burn her up with fire,

     for
     God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and
     handing over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.

     the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.”
