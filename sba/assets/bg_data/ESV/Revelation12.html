     And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman
     clothed with
     the sun, with
     the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.

     And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great

     with seven heads and
     ten horns, and on his heads
     seven diadems.

     His tail swept down
     a third of the stars of heaven and
     cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child
     he might devour it.

     the great dragon was thrown down,

     Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off

     on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to
     the testimony of Jesus. And he stood
     on the sand of the sea.
