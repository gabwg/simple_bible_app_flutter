     And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and
     I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given
     the key to the shaft of

     He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft
     rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and
     the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.
