     Shepherd the Flock of God

     So I exhort the elders among you,
     as a fellow elder and
     a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-2" id="en-ESV-30451">
     <sup class="versenum">
      2
     </sup>
     shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight,
     not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you;
     not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-3" id="en-ESV-30452">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     not
     domineering over those in your charge, but
     being examples to the flock.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-4" id="en-ESV-30453">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     And when
     the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the
     unfading
     crown of glory.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-5" id="en-ESV-30454">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders.
     Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for
     “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-6" id="en-ESV-30455">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-7" id="en-ESV-30456">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7
     </sup>
     casting all your anxieties on him, because
     he cares for you.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-8" id="en-ESV-30457">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     Be sober-minded;
     be watchful. Your
     adversary the devil
     prowls around
     like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-9" id="en-ESV-30458">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     Resist him,
     firm in your faith, knowing that
     the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.
    </span>
    <span class="text 1Pet-5-10" id="en-ESV-30459">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     And
     after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace,
     who has called you to his
     eternal glory in Christ, will himself
     restore,
     confirm, strengthen, and establish you.

     To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
