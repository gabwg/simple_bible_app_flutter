     Now there was a famine in the land, besides
     the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to
     Abimelech king of the
     Philistines.

     And the

     appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; dwell

     Sojourn in this land, and

     I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And

     When the men of the place asked him about his wife,
     he said, “She is my sister,” for
     he feared to say, “My wife,” thinking, “lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah,” because
     she was attractive in appearance.

     When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with

     So Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I thought, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”

     Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and

     He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines

     And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And
     he gave them the names that his father had given them.

     the herdsmen of Gerar
     quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek,
     because they contended with him.

     <sup class="versenum">

     Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah.

     saying, “For now the
