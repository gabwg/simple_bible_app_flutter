     Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.

     And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt,
     where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.

     And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam,

     “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.”

     Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men,
     who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?”

     And they said to him,
     “If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”

     But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.

     And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us’; thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.

     And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”

     And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men,

     King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”

     So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the

     might fulfill his word,

     And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, “What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.
     Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.” So all Israel went to their tents.

     Then King Rehoboam sent
