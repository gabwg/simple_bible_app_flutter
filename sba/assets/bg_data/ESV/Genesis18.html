     And the

      Lord

     appeared to him by the

     He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him.
     When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth

     and said, “O Lord,

     Let a

     while I bring a morsel of bread, that
     you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—
     since you have come to your servant.” So they said, “Do as you have said.”

     And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quick! Three seahs
     of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes.”

    <span class="text Gen-18-7" id="en-ESV-432">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly.

     Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate.

     said, “I will surely return to you

     Now
     Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.

     Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
