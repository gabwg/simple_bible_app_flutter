     When David had passed a little beyond
     the summit,
     Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, bearing two hundred loaves of bread,
     a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred of summer fruits, and a skin of wine.

     And the king said to Ziba, “Why have you brought these?” Ziba answered,
     “The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who
     faint in the wilderness to drink.”

     When King David came to
