     It is actually reported that there is
     sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans,
     for a man has his father's wife.

     And
     you are arrogant! Ought you
     not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.

     For though
     absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing.

     Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that
     a little leaven leavens the whole lump?

     Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
