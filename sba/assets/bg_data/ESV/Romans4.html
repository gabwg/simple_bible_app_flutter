     What then shall we say was gained by Abraham,
     our forefather according to the flesh?

     For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but
     not before God.

     “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”

     Now
     to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.

     just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:

     Is this blessing then only for
     the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised?
     For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.

     How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.

     He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was
     to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,

     For
     the promise to Abraham and his offspring

     That is why it depends on faith,
     in order that the promise may rest on grace and
     be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham,
     who is the father of us all,

     as it is written,
     “I have made you the father of many nations”—in the presence of the God in whom he believed,
     who gives life to the dead and calls into existence
     the things that do not exist.

     He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was
     as good as dead (
     since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered
     the barrenness
     of Sarah's womb.
