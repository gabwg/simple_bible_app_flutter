     Peace with God Through Faith

     Therefore, since we have been justified by faith,
     we
     have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

     Through him we have also
     obtained access by faith
     into this grace
     in which we stand, and
     we
     rejoice
     in hope of the glory of God.

     Not only that, but we

     produces endurance,

    <span class="text Rom-5-4" id="en-ESV-28036">

     <sup class="versenum">

     hope does not put us to shame, because God's love
     has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

     For
     while we were still weak, at the right time
     Christ died for the ungodly.

     For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—

     Death in Adam, Life in Christ

     Therefore, just as
     sin came into the world through one man, and
     death through sin, and
     so death spread to all men
     because
     all sinned—
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-5-13" id="en-ESV-28045">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13

     for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but
     sin is not counted where there is no law.
    </span>
    <span class="text Rom-5-14" id="en-ESV-28046">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14

     Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not
     like the transgression of Adam,
     who was a type of
     the one who was to come.

     But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for
     many.

    <span class="text Rom-5-16" id="en-ESV-28048">

     And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For
     the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought
     justification.

    <span class="text Rom-5-17" id="en-ESV-28049">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness
     reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.

     Therefore, as one trespass
     led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness
     leads to justification and life for
     all men.

     For as by the one man's
     disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's
     obedience the many will be made righteous.

     Now
     the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased,

     as sin reigned in death,
     grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
