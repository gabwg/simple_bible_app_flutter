     Jacob lived in
     the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.

     These are the generations of Jacob.

    <span class="text Gen-37-2">
     Joseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought
     a bad report of them to their father.
    </span>

     Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was
     the son of his old age. And he made him
     a robe of many colors.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-37-4" id="en-ESV-1088">
     <sup class="versenum">

     But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Gen-37-5" id="en-ESV-1089">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-37-6" id="en-ESV-1090">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     He said to them, “Hear this dream that I have dreamed:

    <span class="text Gen-37-7" id="en-ESV-1091">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7
     </sup>
     Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold,
     my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and
     bowed down to my sheaf.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-37-8" id="en-ESV-1092">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     His brothers said to him, “Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
    </span>

   <p>
    <span class="text Gen-37-9" id="en-ESV-1093">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9

     Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, “Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-37-10" id="en-ESV-1094">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and
     your mother and your brothers indeed come
     to bow ourselves to the ground before you?”
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-37-11" id="en-ESV-1095">

     And
     his brothers were jealous of him,
     but his father kept the saying in mind.

     Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near
     Shechem.

     <sup class="versenum">

     And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.”

     So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word.” So he sent him from the Valley of
     Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

     <sup class="versenum">

     And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, “What are you seeking?”

     <sup class="versenum">

     “I am seeking my brothers,” he said. “Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.”

     Dothan.

     They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them

     But when
     Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.”

     And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him”—
     that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father.

     Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a
     caravan of
     Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing
     gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.

     Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it
     if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?

    <span class="text Gen-37-27" id="en-ESV-1111">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and
     let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers listened to him.

     Then
     Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and
     sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels
     of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.

     <sup class="versenum">

     All his sons and all his daughters
