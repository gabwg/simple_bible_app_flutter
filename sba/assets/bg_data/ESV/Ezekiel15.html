     And the word of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     came to me:

     “Son of man, how does
     the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?

    <span class="text Ezek-15-3" id="en-ESV-20758">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take
     a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?

     Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?

     <sup class="versenum">

     Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!

     Therefore thus says the Lord
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      God
     </span>
     :
     Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest,
     which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

     And I will set my face against them. Though
     they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them,
     and you will know that I am the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     ,
     when I set my face against them.
