     I ask, then,
     has God rejected his people? By no means! For
     I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham,
     a member of the tribe of Benjamin.

     God has not rejected his people whom he
     foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?
