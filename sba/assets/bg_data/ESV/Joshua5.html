     The New Generation Circumcised
    </span>
   </h3>
   <p class="chapter-1">
    <span class="text Josh-5-1">

     </span>
     As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites
     who were by the sea,
     heard that the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts
     melted and
     there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Josh-5-2" id="en-ESV-5937">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     At that time the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     said to Joshua, “Make
     flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-5-3" id="en-ESV-5938">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-5-4" id="en-ESV-5939">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them:
     all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt.
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-5-5" id="en-ESV-5940">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-5-6" id="en-ESV-5941">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     For the people of Israel walked
     forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished, because they did not obey the voice of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     ; the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     had sworn to their fathers to give to us,
     a land flowing with milk and honey.
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-5-7" id="en-ESV-5942">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7
     </sup>
     So it was
     their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Josh-5-8" id="en-ESV-5943">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-5-9" id="en-ESV-5944">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     And the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the
     reproach of Egypt from you.” And so the name of that place is called
     Gilgal
     to this day.
    </span>

   <h3>
    <span class="text Josh-5-10" id="en-ESV-5945">
     First Passover in Canaan

   <p>
    <span class="text Josh-5-10">

     </sup>
     While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover
     on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho.
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-5-11" id="en-ESV-5946">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11
     </sup>
     And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-5-12" id="en-ESV-5947">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     And
     the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

   <h3>
    <span class="text Josh-5-13" id="en-ESV-5948">
     The Commander of the

     When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold,
     a man was standing before him
     with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our adversaries?”

     And he said, “No; but I am the commander of the army of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     . Now I have come.” And Joshua
     fell on his face to the earth and worshiped
     and said to him, “What does my lord say to his servant?”

     And the commander of the

      Lord

     's army said to Joshua,
     “Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.
