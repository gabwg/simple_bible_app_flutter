     In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month,
     as I sat in my house, with
     the elders of Judah sitting before me,
     the hand of the Lord
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      God
     </span>
     fell upon me there.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-2" id="en-ESV-20607">

     Then I looked, and behold,
     a form that had the appearance of a man.
     Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like
     gleaming metal.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-3" id="en-ESV-20608">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     He
     put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up
     between earth and heaven and
     brought me in
     visions of God to Jerusalem,
     to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north,
     where was the seat of the
     image of jealousy,
     which provokes to jealousy.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-4" id="en-ESV-20609">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     And behold,
     the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw
     in the valley.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-5" id="en-ESV-20610">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     Then he said to me,
     “Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of
     the altar gate, in the entrance, was this
     image of jealousy.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-6" id="en-ESV-20611">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And he said to me, “Son of man,
     do you see what they are doing,
     the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here,
     to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.”

   <p>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-7" id="en-ESV-20612">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-8" id="en-ESV-20613">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     Then he said to me, “Son of man,
     dig in the wall.” So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-9" id="en-ESV-20614">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9

     And he said to me, “Go in, and see
     the vile abominations that they are committing here.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-10" id="en-ESV-20615">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     So I went in and saw. And there,
     engraved on the wall all around, was
     every form of
     creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-11" id="en-ESV-20616">

     And before them stood
     seventy men of
     the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of
     Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and
     the smoke of the cloud of incense went up.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-12" id="en-ESV-20617">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing
     in the dark, each
     in his room of pictures? For they say,
     ‘The
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     does not see us, the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     has forsaken the land.’”

     He said also to me,
     “You will see still greater abominations that they commit.”

     <sup class="versenum">

     Then he brought me to
     the entrance of the north gate of the house of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-8-15" id="en-ESV-20620">
     <sup class="versenum">
      15

     Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O
     son of man?
     You will see still greater abominations than these.”

    <span class="text Ezek-8-16" id="en-ESV-20621">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And he brought me into
     the inner court of the house of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     . And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     ,
     between the
     porch and
     the altar, were about twenty-five men,
     with their backs to the temple of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , and their faces toward the east, worshiping
     the sun toward the east.

     <sup class="versenum">
      17
     </sup>
     Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O
     son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit
     the abominations that they commit here, that
     they should fill the land with violence and
     provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their
     nose.

     Therefore
     I will act in wrath.
     My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity.
     And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”
