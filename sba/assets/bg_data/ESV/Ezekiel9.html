     Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Bring near the executioners of the city,
     each with his destroying weapon in his hand.”

     And behold, six men came from the direction of
     the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was
     a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. And they went in and stood beside
     the bronze altar.

     Now
     the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to
     the threshold of the house. And he called to
     the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist.

     said to him, “Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and
     put a mark on the foreheads of the men who
     sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it.”

     And to
     the others he said in my hearing, “Pass through the city after him, and strike.
     Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.

     Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but
     touch no one on whom is the mark. And
     begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the house.

     And while they were striking, and I was left alone,
     I fell upon my face, and cried,
     “Ah, Lord

     Then he said to me,
     “The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great.
     The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For
     they say, ‘The
