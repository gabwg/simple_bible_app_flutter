     Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the east of Jeshimon?”

     So Saul arose and went down to
     the wilderness of Ziph with
     three thousand chosen men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.

     And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,

     David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed come.

     Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with
     Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying within
     the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.

     Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab's brother
     Abishai the son of Zeruiah,
     “Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”

     So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there lay Saul sleeping within
     the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground
     at his head, and Abner and the army lay around him.

     Then Abishai said to David,
     “God has given your enemy into your hand this day. Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice.”

     But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can put out his hand
     against the

     And David said,
     “As the

     lives,
     the

     will strike him, or
     his day will come to die,
     or he will go down into battle and perish.

     So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because
     a deep sleep from the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     had fallen upon them.

     Then David went over to the other side and stood far off on the top of the hill, with a great space between them.

     And David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Will you not answer, Abner?” Then Abner answered, “Who are you who calls to the king?”

     This thing that you have done is not good.
     As the

     Saul recognized David's voice and said,

     Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the
