     It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and
     turned aside to a certain
     Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

     There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was
     Shua. He took her and went in to her,
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-38-3" id="en-ESV-1123">
     <sup class="versenum">

     and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name
     Er.

    <span class="text Gen-38-4" id="en-ESV-1124">
     <sup class="versenum">

     She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name
     Onan.

    <span class="text Gen-38-5" id="en-ESV-1125">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name
     Shelah. Judah
     was in Chezib when she bore him.

     And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.

    <span class="text Gen-38-7" id="en-ESV-1127">
     <sup class="versenum">

     But Er, Judah's firstborn,
     was wicked in the sight of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , and the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     put him to death.

     Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to
     your brother's wife and
     perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”

     But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother's wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother.

     Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law,
     “Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up”—for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained
     in her father's house.

     In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died. When Judah
     was comforted, he went up to
     Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-38-13" id="en-ESV-1133">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And when Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,”

     <sup class="versenum">

     she took off her widow's garments
     and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to
     Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up,
     and she had not been given to him in marriage.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-38-15" id="en-ESV-1135">
     <sup class="versenum">

     When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.

     <sup class="versenum">
      16
     </sup>
     He turned to her at the roadside and said, “Come, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-38-17" id="en-ESV-1137">
     <sup class="versenum">

     He answered, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” And she said, “If you give me a pledge, until you send it—”

    <span class="text Gen-38-18" id="en-ESV-1138">
     <sup class="versenum">
      18

     He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She replied,
     “Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gen-38-19" id="en-ESV-1139">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Then she arose and went away, and taking off
     her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.

     When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her.

     And he asked the men of the place, “Where is the cult prostitute
     who was at
     Enaim at the roadside?” And they said, “No cult prostitute has been here.”

    <span class="text Gen-38-22" id="en-ESV-1142">
     <sup class="versenum">

     So he returned to Judah and said, “I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, ‘No cult prostitute has been here.’”

     About three months later Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law
     has been immoral.
     Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality.”
     And Judah said, “Bring her out, and
     let her be burned.”

    <span class="text Gen-38-25" id="en-ESV-1145">
     <sup class="versenum">

     As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.” And she said, “Please identify whose these are,
     the signet and the cord and the staff.”

     Then Judah identified them and said,
     “She is more righteous than I, since
     I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not know her again.

     When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb.

     And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.”

     But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” Therefore his name was called
     Perez.

     Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called
     Zerah.
