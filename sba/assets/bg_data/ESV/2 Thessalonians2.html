     The Man of Lawlessness

     Now concerning
     the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our
     being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Thess-2-2" id="en-ESV-29647">

     not to be quickly shaken in mind or
     alarmed, either
     by a spirit or a
     spoken word, or
     a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that
     the day of the Lord has come.

     Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come,
     unless the rebellion comes first, and
     the man of lawlessness
     is revealed,
     the son of destruction,
    </span>

     who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God,
     proclaiming himself to be God.

     Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?

     <sup class="versenum">

     For
     the mystery of lawlessness
     is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.

     And then
     the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus
     will kill with
     the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by
     the appearance of his coming.

     The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan
     with all power and false signs and wonders,

     and with all wicked deception for
     those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.

     Therefore
     God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe
     what is false,

     <sup class="versenum">

     in order that all may be condemned
     who did not believe the truth but
     had pleasure in unrighteousness.

     But
     we ought always to give thanks to God for you,
     brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you
     as the firstfruits
     to be saved,
     through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.
