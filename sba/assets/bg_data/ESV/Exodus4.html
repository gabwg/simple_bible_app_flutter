     Then Moses answered, “But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘The

     The

     said to Moses, “Put out your hand and catch it by the tail”—so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand—

     the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”

     Again, the

     said to him, “Put your hand inside your cloak.”
