     Now in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned

     in the third year of his reign
     he gave a feast for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him,

     And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa the citadel, both great and small, a feast lasting for seven days in the court of
     the garden of the king's palace.

     On the seventh day,

     Then the king said to

     This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will say the same to all the king's officials, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty.

     If it please the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so
     that it may not be repealed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus. And let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.
