     A Vision of Joshua the High Priest

     Then he showed me
     Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     , and
     Satan
     standing at his right hand to accuse him.

     And the

     said to Satan,
     “The
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     rebuke you, O Satan! The
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     who has
     chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this
     a brand
     plucked from the fire?”

     Now
     Joshua was standing before the angel,
     clothed with filthy garments.

     And the angel said to
     those who were standing before him,
     “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him he said, “Behold,
     I have taken your iniquity away from you, and
     I will clothe you with pure vestments.”

     And I said,
     “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     was standing by.

     solemnly assured
     Joshua,

     Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for
