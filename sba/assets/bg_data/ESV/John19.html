     When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them,

     From then on
     Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend.

     So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on

     Since it was
