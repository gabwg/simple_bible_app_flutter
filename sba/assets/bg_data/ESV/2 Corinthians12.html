     I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and
     revelations of the Lord.

     I know a man
     in Christ who fourteen years ago was
     caught up to
     the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know,
     God knows.

     And I know that this man was caught up into
     paradise—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know,
     God knows—

     On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast,

     though if I should wish to boast,
     I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.

     So
     to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations,
     a thorn was given me in the flesh,
     a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.

     But he said to me,
     <span class="woj">
      “My grace is sufficient for you, for
      my power is made perfect in weakness.”
     </span>
     Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that
     the power of Christ may rest upon me.

     For the sake of Christ, then,

     when I am weak, then I am strong.

     I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was

     Here
     for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for

     sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced.
