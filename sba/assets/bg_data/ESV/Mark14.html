     And the high priest
     tore his garments and said, “What further witnesses do we need?

     You have heard
     his blasphemy. What is your decision?” And they
     all condemned him as
     deserving death.

     And some began
     to spit on him and
     to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards received him
     with blows.

     And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,
    </span>
    <span class="text Mark-14-67" id="en-ESV-24814">
     <sup class="versenum">

     warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”

     But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean.” And he went out into the gateway
     and
     the rooster crowed.

     <sup class="versenum">

     And immediately the rooster crowed
     a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him,
     <span class="woj">
      “Before the rooster crows twice, you will
      deny me three times.”
     </span>
     And he broke down and wept.
