     King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits
     and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on
     the plain of Dura, in
     the province of Babylon.

     Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather
     the satraps, the prefects, and
     the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

     has sent his angel and
     delivered his servants, who

     the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than
     serve and worship any god except their own God.
