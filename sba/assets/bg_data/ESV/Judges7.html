     Then
     Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside
     the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them,
     by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

     said to Gideon, “The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand,

     Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
     ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead.’” Then 22,000 of the people returned, and 10,000 remained.

     said to Gideon, “The people are still too many. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and anyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ shall not go.”

     So he brought the people down to the water. And the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     said to Gideon, “Every one who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself. Likewise, every one who kneels down to drink.”

     And the number of those who lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.

     So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men. And the camp of Midian was below him
     in the valley.

     And the Midianites and the Amalekites and
     all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number,
     as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance.

     When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.”

     As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the

     has given the host of Midian into your hand.”

     And he divided the 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with
     torches inside the jars.

     When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout,

     So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch. And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.

     set

     Gideon sent messengers throughout
     all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them, as far as

     And they captured
     the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb
     at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon
     across the Jordan.
