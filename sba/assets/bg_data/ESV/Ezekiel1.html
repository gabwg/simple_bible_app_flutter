     In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by
     the Chebar canal,
     the heavens were opened, and I saw
     visions of God.

     As I looked, behold,
     a stormy wind came
     out of the north, and a great cloud, with
     brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire,
     as it were gleaming metal.

     And from the midst of it came the likeness of
     four living creatures.
     And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness,

     Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled
     like burnished bronze.

     Under their wings
     on their four sides
     they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:

     Each one of them went straight forward,

     two covered their bodies.

     And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

     Over the heads of the living creatures there was
     the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring
     crystal, spread out above their heads.

     like the sound of many waters, like
     the sound of the

     upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were
