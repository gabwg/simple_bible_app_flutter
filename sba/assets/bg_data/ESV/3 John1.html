     Beloved, it is a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for
     these brothers,
     strangers as they are,

     So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church.
