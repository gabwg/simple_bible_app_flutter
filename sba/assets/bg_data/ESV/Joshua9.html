     As soon as all the kings who were beyond the Jordan
     in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast
     of the Great Sea toward Lebanon,
     the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard of this,

     But when the inhabitants of
     Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
     to Jericho and
     to Ai,

    <span class="text Josh-9-4" id="en-ESV-6042">

     they on their part acted with cunning and went and made ready provisions and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,

    <span class="text Josh-9-5" id="en-ESV-6043">

     with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes. And all their provisions were dry and crumbly.

     And they went to Joshua in
     the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant country, so now make a covenant with us.”

    <span class="text Josh-9-7" id="en-ESV-6045">

     But the men of Israel said to
     the Hivites, “Perhaps you live among us; then

     They said to Joshua,

     They said to him,
     “From a very distant country your servants have come, because of the name of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     your God.
     For we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

    <span class="text Josh-9-10" id="en-ESV-6048">
     <sup class="versenum">

     and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who lived in
     Ashtaroth.

     <sup class="versenum">

     So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them, “We are your servants. Come now, make a covenant with us.”’
    </span>
    <span class="text Josh-9-12" id="en-ESV-6050">

     Here is our bread. It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and crumbly.

     These wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they have burst. And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey.”

     So the men took some of their provisions, but
     did not ask counsel from the

     And Joshua
     made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.

     At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors
     and that they lived among them.

     And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day.
     Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.

     But the people of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     , the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.

     This we will do to them: let them live, lest

     And the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became
     cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, just as the leaders
     had said of them.

     Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, “Why did you deceive us, saying,

     They answered Joshua, “Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the

     your God had
     commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you—so
     we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing.
