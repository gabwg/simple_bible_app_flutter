     The saying is
     trustworthy: If anyone aspires to
     the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.

     Therefore
     an overseer
     must be above reproach,
     the husband of one wife,
     sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable,
     hospitable,
     able to teach,

     not a lover of money.

     <sup class="versenum">

     for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for
     God's church?

     He must not be a recent convert, or he may
     become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.

     Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued,
