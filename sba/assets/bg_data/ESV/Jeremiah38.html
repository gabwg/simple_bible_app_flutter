     Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur,
     Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and
     Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people:

     “Thus says the

      Lord
     </span>
     :
     He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence,
     but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live.

     This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.”

     <sup class="versenum">

     Then the officials said to the king,
     “Let this man be put to death,
     for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking
     the welfare of this people, but their harm.”

     King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands,

     So they took Jeremiah
     and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in
     the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down
     by ropes.
     And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and
     Jeremiah sank in the mud.

     When
     Ebed-melech
     the Ethiopian,
     a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern—the king was sitting

     “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of
     hunger,
     for there is no bread left in the city.”

     So
     Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern
     by ropes.

     Then
     Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and
     the ropes.” Jeremiah did so.
