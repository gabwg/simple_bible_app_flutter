     Now
     Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron,
     each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered
     unauthorized
     fire before the

     came out from before the

     Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     has said: ‘Among
     those who are near me
