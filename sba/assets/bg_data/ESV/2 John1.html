     For
     many deceivers
     have gone out into the world,
     those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.

     Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ,
     does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching
     has both the Father and the Son.
