     Beloved,
     do not believe every spirit, but
     test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for
     many
     false prophets
     have gone out into the world.

     By this you know the Spirit of God:
     every spirit that confesses that
     Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,

     that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and
     now is in the world already.
