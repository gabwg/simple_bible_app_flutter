     And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the

     From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the

     And Samuel said to all the house of Israel,
     “If you are returning to the

     put away the foreign gods and the

     direct your heart to the

     So the people of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and they served the

     Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel at

     So they gathered at

     and drew water and poured it out before the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     “We have sinned against the

     Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

     So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     . And
     Samuel cried out to the

     As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel.
     But the

     Then Samuel
     took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen

     So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the

     The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.
