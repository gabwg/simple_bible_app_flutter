     The

     and said, “My lords,
     please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night
     and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.” They said,
     “No; we will spend the night in the town square.”

     But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

     But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house.

     But they said, “Stand back!” And they said, “This fellow

     he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down.

     blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.

     Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city,
     bring them out of the place.

     So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters,
