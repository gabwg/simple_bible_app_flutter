     Now
     it is superfluous for me to write to you about
     the ministry for the saints,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-9-2" id="en-ESV-28942">
     <sup class="versenum">

     for I know your readiness,
     of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready
     since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-9-3" id="en-ESV-28943">
     <sup class="versenum">

     </sup>
     But
     I am sending
     the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready,
     as I said you would be.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-9-4" id="en-ESV-28944">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Otherwise, if some Macedonians
     come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident.

     So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the
     gift
     you have promised, so that it may be ready
     as a willing gift,
     not as an exaction.

     The point is this:
     whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully
     will also reap bountifully.
