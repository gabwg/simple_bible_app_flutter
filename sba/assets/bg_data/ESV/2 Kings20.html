     In those days
     Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     ,
     ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover.’”

     Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     ,
     please remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and
     with a whole heart,
     and have done what is good in your sight.”
     And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
