     After these things
     God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”

     He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to
     the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”

     So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.

     On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.

     Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy

     And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and
     laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.

     And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”

     When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and
     laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.

     But the angel of the

     called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”
