     The

     said to Moses, “Depart; go up from here, you

     had said to Moses, “Say to the people of Israel, ‘You are a

     consume you. So now
     take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.’”

     Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and

     sought the
