     Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel. None went out, and none came in.

     said to Joshua, “See,

     And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat,

     So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the

     And he said to the people, “Go forward. March around the city and let

     And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the

      Lord

     went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the

     The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the

     So he caused the ark of the

     to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.

     And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.

     On the seventh day they rose early, at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.

     And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for the

     Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she

     But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel
     a thing for destruction and
     bring trouble upon it.

     So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and
     the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.
