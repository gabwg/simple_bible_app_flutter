     When the people saw that Moses
     delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to him,
     “Up, make us gods who shall
     go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”

     And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden
