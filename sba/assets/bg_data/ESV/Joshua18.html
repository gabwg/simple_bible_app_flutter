     So Joshua said to the people of Israel,

     Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land. They shall write a description of it with a view to their inheritances, and then come to me.

     They shall divide it into seven portions.
     Judah shall continue in his territory on the south,
     and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north.

     And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the
