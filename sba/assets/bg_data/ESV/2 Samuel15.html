     After this Absalom
     got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

     And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside
     the way of the gate. And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, “From what city are you?” And when he said, “Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,”

     Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you.”

    <span class="text 2Sam-15-4" id="en-ESV-8394">

     Then Absalom would say,
     “Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice.”

     And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.

     And at the end of four

     And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for
     Ahithophel the Gilonite,
     David's counselor, from his city
     Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Absalom
     kept increasing.
