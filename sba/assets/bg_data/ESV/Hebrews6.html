     Therefore
     let us leave
     the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance
     from dead works and of faith toward God,

     instruction about washings,
     the laying on of hands,
     the resurrection of the dead, and
     eternal judgment.

     For it is impossible, in the case of those
     who have once been enlightened, who have tasted
     the heavenly gift, and
     have shared in the Holy Spirit,

    <span class="text Heb-6-5" id="en-ESV-30033">

     then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since
     they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.

     land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.

     The Certainty of God's Promise

     For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear,
     he swore by himself,
    </span>
    <span class="text Heb-6-14" id="en-ESV-30042">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14

     saying,
     “Surely I will bless you and multiply you.”

    <span class="text Heb-6-15" id="en-ESV-30043">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And thus Abraham,
     having patiently waited, obtained the promise.

    <span class="text Heb-6-16" id="en-ESV-30044">
     <sup class="versenum">
      16

     For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes
     an oath is final for confirmation.

    <span class="text Heb-6-17" id="en-ESV-30045">
     <sup class="versenum">

     So when God desired to show more convincingly to
     the heirs of the promise
     the unchangeable character of his purpose,
     he guaranteed it with an oath,
    </span>
    <span class="text Heb-6-18" id="en-ESV-30046">
     <sup class="versenum">
      18

     so that by two unchangeable things, in which
     it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope
     set before us.

     <sup class="versenum">

     We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into
     the inner place behind the curtain,
