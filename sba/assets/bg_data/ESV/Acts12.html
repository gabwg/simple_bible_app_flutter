     About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.

     and when he saw
     that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during
     the days of Unleavened Bread.

     And when he had seized him, he put him
     in prison, delivering him over to four
     squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.

     So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest
     prayer for him was made to God by the church.

     Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers,
     bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.

     And behold,
     an angel of the Lord
     stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell.
     He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, “Get up quickly.” And
     the chains fell off his hands.

     When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city.

     John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and
     were praying.

     They said to her, “You are out of your mind.” But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, “It is

     But
     motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Tell these things to
     James and to
     the brothers.”
     Then he departed and went to another place.

     Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and
     having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain,
     they asked for peace, because
     their country depended on the king's country for food.
