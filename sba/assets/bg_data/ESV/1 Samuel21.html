     Then David came to
     Nob, to
     Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech
     came to meet David, trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?”

     And David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, ‘Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.’ I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.

     Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.”

     And the priest answered David, “I have no common bread on hand, but there is
     holy bread—
     if the young men have kept themselves from women.”

     And David answered the priest, “Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?”

     So the priest gave him
     the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence,
     which is removed from before the

     Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the

     Then David said to Ahimelech, “Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.”

     And the priest said,
     “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in
     the Valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here.” And David said, “There is none like that; give it to me.”
