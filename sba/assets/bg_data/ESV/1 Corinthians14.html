     Pursue love, and

     For
     one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit.

     On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation.

     The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.

     Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but
     even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.

     Now, brothers,
     if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some
     revelation or knowledge or prophecy or
     teaching?

     If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played?

     So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be
     speaking into the air.

     There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning,

     a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.

     Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.

     Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider
     say
     “Amen” to
     your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?

     Brothers,
     do not be children in your thinking.
     Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be

     In the Law it is written,
     “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”

     Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign
     not for unbelievers but for believers.

     If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter,
     will they not say that you are out of your minds?

     What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has
     a hymn,
