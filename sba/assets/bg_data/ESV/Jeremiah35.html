     The word that came to Jeremiah from the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     in the days of
     Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:

     “Go to the house of the

     So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites.

     into
     the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah,

     Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.”
