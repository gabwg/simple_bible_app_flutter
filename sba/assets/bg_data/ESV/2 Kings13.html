     In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.

     Now when Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash king of Israel went down to him and wept before him, crying,

     Then
     the man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Syria only
