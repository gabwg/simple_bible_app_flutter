     If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.

     And if I have
     prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith,
     so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

     If I give away all I have, and

     Love is patient and
     kind; love
     does not envy or boast; it
     is not arrogant

     does not insist on its own way; it
     is not irritable or resentful;

     it

     Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,

     Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.

     we know in part and we prophesy in part,

     When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.

     For
     now we see in a mirror dimly, but
     then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as
     I have been fully known.

     So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
