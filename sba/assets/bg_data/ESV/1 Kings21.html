     Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in
     Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

     And after this Ahab said to Naboth,
     “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house, and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.”

     And Ahab
     went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food.
