     After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,

     And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.

    <span class="text Gen-41-4" id="en-ESV-1200">

     And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke.

     And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.

    <span class="text Gen-41-6" id="en-ESV-1202">
     <sup class="versenum">

     So in the morning
     his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the
     magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.

     When Pharaoh was

     A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him,
     he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.
