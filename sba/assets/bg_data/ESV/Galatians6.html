     Bear One Another's Burdens

     Brothers,
     if anyone is caught in any transgression,
     you who are spiritual should restore him in
     a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-6-2" id="en-ESV-29174">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Bear one another's burdens, and
     so fulfill
     the law of Christ.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-6-3" id="en-ESV-29175">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For
     if anyone thinks he is something,
     when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

    <span class="text Gal-6-4" id="en-ESV-29176">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     But let each one
     test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-6-5" id="en-ESV-29177">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For
     each will have to bear his own load.

    <span class="text Gal-6-6" id="en-ESV-29178">

     Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.

     Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for
     whatever one sows, that will he also reap.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-6-8" id="en-ESV-29180">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For
     the one who sows to his own flesh
     will from the flesh reap corruption, but
     the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.

    <span class="text Gal-6-9" id="en-ESV-29181">

     And
     let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap,
     if we do not give up.

     So then,
     as we have opportunity, let us
     do good to everyone, and especially to those who are
     of the household of faith.

     It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh
     who would force you to be circumcised, and only
     in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
