     Jethro,
     the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     had brought Israel out of Egypt.

     two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (
     for he said,
     “I have been a sojourner

     had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the
