     Now the prophets,

     Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.

     At the same time
     Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus:

     And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was
