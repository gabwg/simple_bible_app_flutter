     Again the anger of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying,

     So the king said to Joab, the commander of the army,

     from Dan to Beersheba, and number the people, that I may know the number of the people.”

     your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see it, but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?”

     But the king's word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.

     They crossed the Jordan and began from

     Then they came to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites;

     David's heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the

     “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O

     So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, “Shall
     three

     the angel of the

     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the

      Lord

     your God
     accept you.”
