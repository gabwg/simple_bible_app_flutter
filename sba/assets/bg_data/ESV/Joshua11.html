     When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard of this, he
     sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

     and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the
     Arabah south of
     Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and
     in Naphoth-dor on the
     west,

     Jebusites in the hill country, and the
     Hivites under
     Hermon in the land of
     Mizpah.

     And they came out with all their troops, a great horde, in number
     like the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.

     And the

     </span>
     said to Joshua,
     “Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give over all of them, slain, to Israel. You shall
     hamstring their horses and burn their

     So Joshua and all his warriors came

     And the

     gave them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them as far as
     Great Sidon and
     Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of
     Mizpeh. And they struck them until he left none remaining.

    <span class="text Josh-11-9" id="en-ESV-6117">

     just as the

      Lord
     </span>
     said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.

     And Joshua turned back at that time and captured
     Hazor and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms.

     And they struck with the sword all who were in it, devoting them to destruction;
     there was none left that breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire.

      12

     And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua captured, and struck them with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction,
     just as Moses the servant of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     <sup class="versenum">

     And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the people of Israel took for their plunder. But every person they struck with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any who breathed.

     had commanded Moses his servant,

     Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below
     Mount Hermon. And he captured

     There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except
     the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took them all in battle.

     's doing
     to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed,
     just as the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     And Joshua came at that time and cut off
     the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction with their cities.

     There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel. Only in Gaza,

     had spoken to Moses.
     And Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel
     according to their tribal allotments. And the land had rest from war.
