     There was a man in the land of
     Uz whose name was
     Job, and that man was
     blameless and upright, one who
     feared God and
     turned away from evil.

     There were born to him
     seven sons and three daughters.

     He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all
     the people of the east.

     His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.

     And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and
     consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and
     offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my children have sinned, and
     cursed
     God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.
