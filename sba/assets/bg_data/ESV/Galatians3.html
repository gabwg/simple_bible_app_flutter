     By Faith, or by Works of the Law?

     O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you?
     It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly
     portrayed as crucified.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-2" id="en-ESV-29088">
     <sup class="versenum">
      2
     </sup>
     Let me ask you only this:
     Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by
     hearing with faith?
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-3" id="en-ESV-29089">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     Are you so foolish?
     Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by
     the flesh?
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-4" id="en-ESV-29090">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     Did you suffer
     so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain?
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-5" id="en-ESV-29091">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and
     works miracles among you do so
     by works of the law, or by hearing with faith—
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-6" id="en-ESV-29092">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     just as
     Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Gal-3-7" id="en-ESV-29093">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7
     </sup>
     Know then that it is
     those of faith who are
     the sons of Abraham.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-8" id="en-ESV-29094">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     And the Scripture, foreseeing that
     God would justify
     the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying,
     “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-9" id="en-ESV-29095">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
    </span>

   <h3>
    <span class="text Gal-3-10" id="en-ESV-29096">
     The Righteous Shall Live by Faith
    </span>
   </h3>
   <p>
    <span class="text Gal-3-10">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     For all who rely on works of the law are
     under a curse; for it is written,
     “Cursed be everyone who does not
     abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-11" id="en-ESV-29097">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11
     </sup>
     Now it is evident that
     no one is justified before God by the law, for
     “The righteous shall live by faith.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-12" id="en-ESV-29098">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     But the law is not of faith, rather
     “The one who does them shall live by them.”
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-13" id="en-ESV-29099">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13
     </sup>
     Christ
     redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written,
     “Cursed is everyone who is hanged
     on a tree”—
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-14" id="en-ESV-29100">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14
     </sup>
     so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might
     come to the Gentiles, so that
     we might receive
     the promised Spirit
     through faith.
    </span>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <span class="text Gal-3-15" id="en-ESV-29101">
     The Law and the Promise
    </span>
   </h3>
   <p>
    <span class="text Gal-3-15">
     <sup class="versenum">
      15
     </sup>
     To give a human example, brothers:
     even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-16" id="en-ESV-29102">
     <sup class="versenum">
      16
     </sup>
     Now
     the promises were made
     to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one,
     “And to your offspring,” who is Christ.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-17" id="en-ESV-29103">
     <sup class="versenum">
      17
     </sup>
     This is what I mean: the law, which came
     430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as
     to make the promise void.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-18" id="en-ESV-29104">
     <sup class="versenum">
      18
     </sup>
     For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but
     God gave it to Abraham by a promise.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Gal-3-19" id="en-ESV-29105">
     <sup class="versenum">
      19
     </sup>
     Why then the law?
     It was added because of transgressions,
     until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was
     put in place through angels
     by an intermediary.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-20" id="en-ESV-29106">
     <sup class="versenum">
      20
     </sup>
     Now
     an intermediary implies more than one, but
     God is one.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Gal-3-21" id="en-ESV-29107">
     <sup class="versenum">
      21
     </sup>
     Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For
     if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-22" id="en-ESV-29108">
     <sup class="versenum">
      22
     </sup>
     But the Scripture
     imprisoned everything under sin, so that
     the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given
     to those who believe.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text Gal-3-23" id="en-ESV-29109">
     <sup class="versenum">
      23
     </sup>
     Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law,
     imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-24" id="en-ESV-29110">
     <sup class="versenum">
      24
     </sup>
     So then,
     the law was our
     guardian until Christ came,
     in order that we might be justified by faith.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-25" id="en-ESV-29111">
     <sup class="versenum">
      25
     </sup>
     But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-26" id="en-ESV-29112">
     <sup class="versenum">
      26
     </sup>
     for in Christ Jesus
     you are all sons of God, through faith.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-27" id="en-ESV-29113">
     <sup class="versenum">
      27
     </sup>
     For as many of you as
     were baptized
     into Christ have
     put on Christ.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-28" id="en-ESV-29114">
     <sup class="versenum">
      28
     </sup>
     There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave
     nor free,
     there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
    </span>
    <span class="text Gal-3-29" id="en-ESV-29115">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And
     if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring,
     heirs according to promise.
