     Evil Under the Sun

     Again I
     saw all
     the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had
     no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.

    <span class="text Eccl-4-2" id="en-ESV-17384">

     And I
     thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.

    <span class="text Eccl-4-3" id="en-ESV-17385">

     But
     better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.

     Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is
     vanity
     and a striving after wind.

     The fool
     folds his hands and
     eats his own flesh.

     Better is a handful of
     quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.

    <span class="text Eccl-4-7" id="en-ESV-17389">

     Again, I saw vanity under the sun:
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-4-8" id="en-ESV-17390">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his
     eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks,
     “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity and an unhappy
     business.
    </span>

   <p>
    <span class="text Eccl-4-9" id="en-ESV-17391">

     Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-4-10" id="en-ESV-17392">
     <sup class="versenum">

     For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!
    </span>
    <span class="text Eccl-4-11" id="en-ESV-17393">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Again, if two lie together, they keep warm,
     but how can one keep warm alone?

     <sup class="versenum">

     And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

     Better was
     a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how
     to take advice.

     For he went
     from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.

    <span class="text Eccl-4-15" id="en-ESV-17397">
     <sup class="versenum">

     I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that
     youth who was to stand in the king's
     place.

     There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is
     vanity and a striving after wind.
