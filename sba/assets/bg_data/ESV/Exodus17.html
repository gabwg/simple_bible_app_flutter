     All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you
     test the

     But the people thirsted there for water, and
     the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”

     So Moses cried to the

     , “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready

     And the

     said to Moses, “Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with

     Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.

     And he called the name of the place

     because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the

     But Moses' hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and
