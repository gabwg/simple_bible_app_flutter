     Then he led me out into
     the outer court,
     toward the north, and he brought me to
     the chambers that were opposite
     the separate yard and opposite
     the building on the north.

     The length of the building whose door faced north was
     a hundred cubits,
     and
     the breadth fifty cubits.

     Facing
     the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing
     the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was
     gallery
     against gallery in three stories.

     And
     before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and
     a hundred cubits long,
     and
     their doors were on the north.

     Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building.

     For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones.

     And
     there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers,
     fifty cubits long.

     For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite
     the nave
     were
     a hundred cubits long.

     Below these chambers was
     an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.

     In the thickness of
     the wall of the court, on the south
     also, opposite
     the yard and opposite
     the building, there were
     chambers

     <sup class="versenum">
      11

     with
     a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits
     and arrangements and
     doors,
    </span>
    <span class="text Ezek-42-12" id="en-ESV-21565">
     <sup class="versenum">

     the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them.

     Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers opposite
     the yard are the holy chambers,
     where the priests who approach the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     shall eat the
     most holy offerings. There they shall put the most holy offerings—
     the grain offering,
     the sin offering, and
     the guilt offering—for the place is holy.

     <sup class="versenum">
      14

     When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court
     without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy.
     They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people.”

     Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by
     the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around.

     He measured the east side with
     the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.

     He measured it on the four sides. It had
     a wall around it,
     500 cubits long and
     500 cubits broad,
     to make a separation between the holy and the common.
