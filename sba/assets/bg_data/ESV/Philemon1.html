     Paul,

     Accordingly,
     though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do

     <sup class="versenum">

     yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now

    </span>
    <span class="text Phlm-1-10" id="en-ESV-29932">
     <sup class="versenum">

     I appeal to you for

     I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me

     but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be
     by compulsion but of your own accord.

     For this perhaps is why
     he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,

     no longer as a bondservant
     but more than a bondservant, as
     a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you,
     both in the flesh and in the Lord.

     I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.

     At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for

     I will be graciously given to you.
