     Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head

     When you depart from me today, you will meet two men by
     Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you,

     your father has ceased to care about the donkeys and is anxious about you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?”’

     from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying.
