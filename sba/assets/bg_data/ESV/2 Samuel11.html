     In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged
     Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.

     It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on
     the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.

     And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is not this
     Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of
     Uriah the Hittite?”

     So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (
     Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house.

     Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and

     When they told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”

     Uriah said to David,
     “The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and
     the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and
     as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.”

     And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank,
     so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with
     the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.

     In the morning David

     Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’”
