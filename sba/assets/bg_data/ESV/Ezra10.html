     While Ezra prayed and
     made confession, weeping and
     casting himself down
     before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children, gathered to him out of Israel, for the people wept bitterly.

     And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra:
     “We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.

     let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and

     those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done

     Then Ezra withdrew

     chamber of
     Jehohanan the son of
     Eliashib, where he spent the night,
     neither
     eating bread nor drinking water, for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles.

     Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the
