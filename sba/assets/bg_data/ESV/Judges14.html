     Samson went down to
     Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines.

     Then he came up and told his father and mother, “I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah.
     Now get her for me as my wife.”

     But his father and mother said to him, “Is there not a woman among the daughters
     of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the
     uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes.”

     His father and mother did not know that it was
     from the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     , for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines.
     At that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.

     Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came toward him roaring.

     Then the Spirit of the

     rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.

     After some days he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.

     He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion.

     And Samson said to them,
     “Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can tell me what it is, within
     the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty
