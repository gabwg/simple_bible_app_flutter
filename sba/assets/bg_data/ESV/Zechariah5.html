     Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying

     And he said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying
     scroll. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.”

     Then he said to me, “This is
     the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land. For everyone who
     steals shall be cleaned out according to what is on one side, and everyone who

     shall be cleaned out according to what is on the other side.

     Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me,
     “Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out.”
