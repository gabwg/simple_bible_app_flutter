     I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the
     meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!—

     I beg of you
     that when I am present I may not have to show
     boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh.

     For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh.

     our warfare are not of the flesh but have
     divine power
     to destroy strongholds.

     We destroy arguments and

     obey Christ,

     Look at what is before your eyes.
     If anyone is confident that he is Christ's, let him remind himself that just as
     he is Christ's,
     so also are we.

     For even if I boast a little too much of
     our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed.

     Not that we dare to classify or
     compare ourselves with some of those who
     are commending themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they are
