     Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.

     For
     we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says,
     he is a perfect man,
     able also to bridle his whole body.

     Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.

     So also the tongue is a small member, yet
     it boasts of great things.

     And
     the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members,
     staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life,
     and set on fire by hell.

     From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers,

     the wisdom from above is first pure, then
