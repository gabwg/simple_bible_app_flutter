     At that time
     Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus,

     “This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.”

     Herod had seized John and bound him and

     Now when Jesus heard this,

     Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish,
