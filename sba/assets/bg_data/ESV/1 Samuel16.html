     The

     said to Samuel,
     “How long will you grieve over Saul, since
     I have rejected him from being king over Israel?
     Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite,
     for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”

      Lord
     </span>
     said, “Take a heifer with you and say,

     Samuel did what the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     commanded and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city
     came to meet him trembling and said,
     “Do you come peaceably?”

     And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     .
     Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.

     When they came, he looked on
     Eliab and thought, “Surely the

     But the

     said to Samuel,
     “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance,
     but the

     Then Jesse called
     Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has the

     Then Jesse made

     Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said,
     “There remains yet the youngest,
     but behold, he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse,
     “Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.”

     ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the

     said,

     Then Samuel took
     the horn of oil

     rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.

     Let our lord now command your servants

     So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me.”

     One of the young men answered, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing,
     a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence,
     and the

     Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son,

     And
     whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre
     and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the harmful spirit departed from him.
