     And the people of Israel again
     did what was evil in the sight of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     , so the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     gave them
     into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.

     There was a certain man of
     Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah.
     And his wife was barren and had no children.

     And the angel of the

      Lord
     </span>
     appeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold, you are barren and have not borne children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.

     Therefore be careful
     and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean,

     <sup class="versenum">

     for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son.
     No razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be
     a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall
     begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”

     Then the woman came and told her husband,
     “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome.
     I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name,

     Then Manoah prayed to the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     and said, “O Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do with the child who will be born.”

     And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. But Manoah her husband was not with her.

     Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the
