     Now the word of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     came to
     Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

     “Arise, go to
     Nineveh, that
     great city, and call out against it,
     for their evil
     has come up before me.”

    <span class="text Jonah-1-3" id="en-ESV-22535">

     But Jonah
     rose to flee to
     Tarshish from the presence of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     . He went down to
     Joppa and found a ship going to
     Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to
     Tarshish,
     away from the presence of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     But
     the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord
     </span>
     hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened
     to break up.

    <span class="text Jonah-1-5" id="en-ESV-22537">

     Then the mariners were afraid, and
     each cried out to his god. And
     they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep.

     So the captain came and said to him, “What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise,
     call out to your god!
     Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we may not perish.”

     And they said to one another, “Come, let us
     cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.

     Then they said to him, “Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?”

     Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, “What is this that you have done!” For the men knew that
     he was fleeing from the presence of the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?” For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.

     He said to them, “Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you,

     Nevertheless, the men rowed hard
     to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.

     Therefore they called out to the

     , “O
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     , let us not perish for this man's life, and
     lay not on us innocent blood,
