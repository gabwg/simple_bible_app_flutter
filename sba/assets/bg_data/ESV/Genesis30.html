     When Rachel saw that

     Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God,

     In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found

     <sup class="versenum">

     Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks,

    <span class="text Gen-30-42" id="en-ESV-873">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Thus the man
     increased greatly and
     had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
