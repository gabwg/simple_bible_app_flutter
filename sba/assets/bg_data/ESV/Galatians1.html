     Paul, an

     I am astonished that you are
     so quickly deserting
     him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to
     a different gospel—

    <span class="text Gal-1-7" id="en-ESV-29048">

     not that there is another one, but
     there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.

     let him be accursed.

     For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying
     to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a

     I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it.

     was pleased to reveal his Son to
     me, in order
     that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone;
