     Then
     all the people of Israel came out,

     And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said,
     “I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.

     So I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel, for they have committed abomination and
