     The Healing at the Pool on the Sabbath

     After this there was a

     Now there is in Jerusalem by
     the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic
     called Bethesda,
     which has five roofed colonnades.

     In these lay a multitude of invalids—blind, lame, and

    <span class="text John-5-5" id="en-ESV-26204">

     One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.

     When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him,
     <span class="woj">
      “Do you want to be healed?”

    <span class="text John-5-7" id="en-ESV-26206">

     The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.”

    <span class="text John-5-8" id="en-ESV-26207">
     <sup class="versenum">

     Jesus said to him,

      “Get up, take up your bed, and walk.”

    </span>
    <span class="text John-5-9" id="en-ESV-26208">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.
    </span>

   <p>
    <span class="text John-5-9">
     Now that day was the Sabbath.

     So the Jews
     said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and
     it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.”
    </span>
    <span class="text John-5-11" id="en-ESV-26210">
     <sup class="versenum">

     But he answered them, “The man who healed me, that man said to me,

      ‘Take up your bed, and walk.’
     </span>
     ”
    </span>
    <span class="text John-5-12" id="en-ESV-26211">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12

     They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?”

    <span class="text John-5-13" id="en-ESV-26212">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13

     Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for
     Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.

    <span class="text John-5-14" id="en-ESV-26213">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14

     Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him,
     <span class="woj">
      “See, you are well!
      Sin no more,
      that nothing worse may happen to you.”

    <span class="text John-5-15" id="en-ESV-26214">

     The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.

     <sup class="versenum">

     And this was why the Jews
     were persecuting Jesus,
     because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.

     This was why the Jews
     were seeking all the more to kill him,

     breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God
     his own Father,
     making himself equal with God.
