     In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days
     the tribe of the people of Dan was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them.

     So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe,
     from Zorah and from Eshtaol,
     to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, “Go and explore the land.” And they came
     to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.

     When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. And they turned aside and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?”

     he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”

     Then the five men departed and came to
     Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians,
     quiet and unsuspecting, lacking
     nothing that is in the earth and possessing wealth, and how
     they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.

     They said,
     “Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good.
     And will you do nothing?
     Do not be slow to go, to enter in and possess the land.

     As soon as you go, you will come to an

     So 600 men of the tribe of Dan,

     and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called
     Mahaneh-dan

     Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers, “Do you know that

     the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took

     And they said to him, “Keep quiet;
     put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us
     a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?”

     quiet and unsuspecting, and
     struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
