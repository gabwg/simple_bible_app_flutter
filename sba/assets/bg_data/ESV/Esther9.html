     Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar,
     on the thirteenth day of the same,
     when the king's command and edict were about to be carried out,
     on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, the reverse occurred: the Jews gained mastery over those who hated them.

     The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could stand against them,
     for the fear of them had fallen on all peoples.

     All the officials of the provinces and
     the satraps and the governors and the royal agents also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.

     more and more powerful.

     That very day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was reported to the king.

     And the king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and also the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces!
     Now what is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what further is your request? It shall be fulfilled.”

     tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict. And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.”

     So the king commanded this to be done. A decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.

     The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed 300 men in Susa, but they laid no hands on the plunder.

     Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king's provinces also
     gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies and killed 75,000 of those who hated them, but they laid no hands on the plunder.

     Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in

     a holiday, and
     as a day on which they send gifts of food to one another.

     Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term

     Then Queen Esther,
