     When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes
     and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and he cried out with a loud and bitter cry.

     He went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one was allowed to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth.

     And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews,
     with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and many of them
     lay in sackcloth and ashes.

     When Esther's young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.

     Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was.

     Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate,

     and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him,
     and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.

     Mordecai also gave him
     a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction,
     that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him
     on behalf of her people.

     “All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside
     the inner court without being called,
     there is but one law—to be put to death, except the one
     to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live. But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.”

     Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not think to yourself that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.

     For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”

     “Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and do not eat or drink for
     three days, night or day. I and my young women will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law,
     and if I perish, I perish.”
