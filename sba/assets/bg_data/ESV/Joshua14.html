     These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which
     Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit.

     Their inheritance was
     by lot, just as the

     For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan,
     but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.

     For
     the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance.

     Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the
     Kenizzite said to him, “You know
     what the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

     I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the

     But
     my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the

    <span class="text Josh-14-9" id="en-ESV-6197">

     And Moses swore on that day, saying,
     ‘Surely the land
     on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the

     Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day,
     because he wholly followed the
