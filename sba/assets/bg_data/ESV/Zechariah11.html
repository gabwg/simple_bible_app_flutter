     Thus said the

     Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the

     I have become rich,’ and their own shepherds have no pity on them.

     For
     I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the
     <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
      Lord

     So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named
     Favor, the other I named
     Union.
     And I tended the sheep.

     In one month
     I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me.

     So I said, “I will not be your shepherd.
     What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another.”

     So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the

     Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” And they weighed out as my wages
     thirty pieces of silver.

     the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the
