     Therefore, holy brothers,
     you who share in
     a heavenly calling, consider Jesus,
     the apostle and high priest of our confession,

     just as Moses also was faithful in all God's
     house.

     For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses—as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.

     Now Moses was faithful in all God's house
     as a servant,
     to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,

     a son. And
     we are his house, if indeed we
     hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.
