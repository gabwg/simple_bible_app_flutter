     Encouragement to Give Generously

   </h3>
   <p class="chapter-1">
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-1">
     <span class="chapternum">

     </span>
     We want you to know, brothers,
     about the grace of God that has been
     given among the churches of Macedonia,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-2" id="en-ESV-28918">
     <sup class="versenum">
      2
     </sup>
     for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and
     their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-3" id="en-ESV-28919">
     <sup class="versenum">
      3
     </sup>
     For they gave
     according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord,
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-4" id="en-ESV-28920">
     <sup class="versenum">
      4
     </sup>
     begging us earnestly
     for the favor
     of taking part in
     the relief of the saints—
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-5" id="en-ESV-28921">
     <sup class="versenum">
      5
     </sup>
     and this, not as we expected, but they
     gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-6" id="en-ESV-28922">
     <sup class="versenum">
      6
     </sup>
     Accordingly,
     we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you
     this act of grace.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-7" id="en-ESV-28923">
     <sup class="versenum">
      7
     </sup>
     But as
     you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you
     —
     see that you excel in this act of grace also.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-8" id="en-ESV-28924">
     <sup class="versenum">
      8
     </sup>
     I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-9" id="en-ESV-28925">
     <sup class="versenum">
      9
     </sup>
     For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
     though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-10" id="en-ESV-28926">
     <sup class="versenum">
      10
     </sup>
     And in this matter
     I give my judgment:
     this benefits you, who
     a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-11" id="en-ESV-28927">
     <sup class="versenum">
      11
     </sup>
     So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-12" id="en-ESV-28928">
     <sup class="versenum">
      12
     </sup>
     For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable
     according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-13" id="en-ESV-28929">
     <sup class="versenum">
      13
     </sup>
     For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, but that as a matter of fairness
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-14" id="en-ESV-28930">
     <sup class="versenum">
      14
     </sup>
     your abundance at the present time should supply
     their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be fairness.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-15" id="en-ESV-28931">
     <sup class="versenum">
      15
     </sup>
     As it is written,
     “Whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack.”

     Commendation of Titus

     But
     thanks be to God,
     who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you.

     For
     he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going
     to you of his own accord.

     With him we are sending
     the brother who is famous among
     all the churches for his preaching of the gospel.

    <span class="text 2Cor-8-19" id="en-ESV-28935">
     <sup class="versenum">

     And not only that, but he has been
     appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of
     grace that is being ministered by us,
     for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-20" id="en-ESV-28936">
     <sup class="versenum">
      20

     We take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us,

    <span class="text 2Cor-8-21" id="en-ESV-28937">
     <sup class="versenum">
      21

     for
     we aim at what is honorable
     not only in the Lord's sight but also in the sight of man.

     <sup class="versenum">
      22
     </sup>
     And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you.
    </span>
    <span class="text 2Cor-8-23" id="en-ESV-28939">
     <sup class="versenum">
      23
     </sup>
     As for Titus, he is
     my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. And as for our brothers, they are messengers
     of the churches, the glory of Christ.

     So give proof before the churches of your love and of
     our boasting about you to these men.
