   Saul told his son Jonathan
   and all the attendants to kill
   David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David

   and warned him, “My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding
   and stay there.

  <span class="text 1Sam-19-3" id="en-NIV-7710">

   I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I’ll speak
   to him about you and will tell you what I find out.”

   Jonathan spoke
   well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king do wrong
   to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.

   He took his life
   in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The

   won a great victory
   for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent
   man like David by killing him for no reason?”

  <span class="text 1Sam-19-6" id="en-NIV-7713">

   Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: “As surely as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.

   Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.

   But an evil

   from the

  <span class="text 1Sam-19-10" id="en-NIV-7717">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded
   him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.

   Saul sent men to David’s house to watch
   it and to kill him in the morning.
   But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t run for your life tonight, tomorrow you’ll be killed.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-19-12" id="en-NIV-7719">

   So Michal let David down through a window,

   Then Michal took an idol
   and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats’ hair at the head.

   But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats’ hair.

   Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?”

   Michal told him, “He said to me, ‘Let me get away. Why should I kill you?’”

   When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah
   and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.

   Word came to Saul: “David is in Naioth at Ramah”;

   so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets
   prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on
   Saul’s men, and they also prophesied.

  <span class="text 1Sam-19-21" id="en-NIV-7728">

   Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.

   Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”

   “Over in Naioth at Ramah,” they said.

   He stripped
   off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel’s
   presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
