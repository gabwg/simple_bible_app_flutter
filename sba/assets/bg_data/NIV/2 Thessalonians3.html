   In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
   we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from
   every believer who is idle and disruptive
   and does not live according to the teaching
   you received from us.

   For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example.
   We were not idle when we were with you,

   nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked
   night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.

  <span class="text 2Thess-3-9" id="en-NIV-29688">

   We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help,
   but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.

   we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work
   shall not eat.”
