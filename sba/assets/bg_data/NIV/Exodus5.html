   Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go,
   so that they may hold a festival
   to me in the wilderness.’”

   Pharaoh said, “Who is the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ,
   that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   and I will not let Israel go.”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-5-3" id="en-NIV-1636">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey
   into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   our God, or he may strike us with plagues
   or with the sword.”

   But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor?
   Get back to your work!”
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-5" id="en-NIV-1638">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous,
   and you are stopping them from working.”

  <span class="text Exod-5-6" id="en-NIV-1639">

   That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers
   and overseers in charge of the people:
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-7" id="en-NIV-1640">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   “You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks;
   let them go and gather their own straw.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-8" id="en-NIV-1641">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota.
   They are lazy;
   that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-9" id="en-NIV-1642">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-5-10" id="en-NIV-1643">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   Then the slave drivers
   and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-11" id="en-NIV-1644">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced
   at all.’”
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-12" id="en-NIV-1645">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-13" id="en-NIV-1646">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-14" id="en-NIV-1647">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed,
   demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-5-15" id="en-NIV-1648">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15

   Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-16" id="en-NIV-1649">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16

   Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-5-17" id="en-NIV-1650">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17

   Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy!
   That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-18" id="en-NIV-1651">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Now get to work.
   You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”

   The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.”

   <sup class="versenum">

   When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-5-21" id="en-NIV-1654">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21

   and they said, “May the

   look on you and judge
   you! You have made us obnoxious
   to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword
