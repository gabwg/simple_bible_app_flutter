   I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means!
   I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham,
   from the tribe of Benjamin.

   God did not reject his people,
   whom he foreknew.
   Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel:
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-11-3" id="en-NIV-28213">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me”
   ?
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-11-4" id="en-NIV-28214">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-11-5" id="en-NIV-28215">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So too, at the present time there is a remnant
   chosen by grace.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-11-6" id="en-NIV-28216">

   if it were, grace would no longer be grace.

   Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all!
   Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles
   to make Israel envious.

   If some of the branches have been broken off,
