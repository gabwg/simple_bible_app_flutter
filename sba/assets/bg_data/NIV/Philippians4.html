   my joy and crown, stand firm
   in the Lord in this way, dear friends!

   Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers,

   Do not be anxious about anything,

   I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me.
   Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.

   I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content

   I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry,

   Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days
   of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia,
   not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only;

   I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus
