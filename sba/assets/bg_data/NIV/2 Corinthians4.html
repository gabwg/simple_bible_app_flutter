   Therefore, since through God’s mercy
   we have this ministry, we do not lose heart.

   Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways;
   we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God.
   On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience
   in the sight of God.

   The god
   of this age
   has blinded
   the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ,

   made his light shine in our hearts
