   Then Joseph could no longer control himself
   before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!”
   So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.

   Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?”

   Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.”

   When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come,

   Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals

   “You are also directed to tell them, ‘Do this: Take some carts

   So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts,

   And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys
