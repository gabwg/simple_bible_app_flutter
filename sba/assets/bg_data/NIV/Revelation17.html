   One of the seven angels
   who had the seven bowls
   came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment
   of the great prostitute,

   There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet

   The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls.
   She held a golden cup
   in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.
