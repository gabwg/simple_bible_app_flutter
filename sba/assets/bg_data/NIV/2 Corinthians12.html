   I must go on boasting.
   Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations
   from the Lord.

   I know a man in Christ
   who fourteen years ago was caught up
   to the third heaven.
   Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-12-3" id="en-NIV-29026">

   And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows—

   was caught up
   to paradise
   and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell.

  <span class="text 2Cor-12-5" id="en-NIV-29028">

   I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.

   <sup class="versenum">

   Even if I should choose to boast,
   I would not be a fool,
   because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say,

   or because of these surpassingly great revelations.
   Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh,
   a messenger of Satan,
   to torment me.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-12-8" id="en-NIV-29031">

   Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.

   But he said to me,
   <span class="woj">
    “My grace
    is sufficient for you, for my power
    is made perfect in weakness.
    ”
   </span>
   Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.

   That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight
   in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships,
   in persecutions,
   in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

   I have made a fool of myself,

   Now I am ready to visit you for the third time,
   and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents,
   but parents for their children.

   For I am afraid that when I come
   I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be.
   I fear that there may be discord,

   slander,
   gossip,
   arrogance

   in which they have indulged.
