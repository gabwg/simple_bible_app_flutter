   Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit
   but as people who are still worldly
   —mere infants
   in Christ.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-2" id="en-NIV-28413">

   I gave you milk, not solid food,
   for you were not yet ready for it.
   Indeed, you are still not ready.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-3" id="en-NIV-28414">
   <sup class="versenum">
    3
   </sup>
   You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling
   among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-4" id="en-NIV-28415">
   <sup class="versenum">
    4
   </sup>
   For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,”
   are you not mere human beings?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-5" id="en-NIV-28416">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   What, after all, is Apollos?
   And what is Paul? Only servants,
   through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-6" id="en-NIV-28417">

   I planted the seed,
   Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-7" id="en-NIV-28418">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-8" id="en-NIV-28419">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-9" id="en-NIV-28420">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   For we are co-workers in God’s service;
   you are God’s field,
   God’s building.

  <span class="text 1Cor-3-10" id="en-NIV-28421">

   By the grace God has given me,
   I laid a foundation
   as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-11" id="en-NIV-28422">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-12" id="en-NIV-28423">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-13" id="en-NIV-28424">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   their work will be shown for what it is,
   because the Day
   will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-14" id="en-NIV-28425">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-15" id="en-NIV-28426">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-16" id="en-NIV-28427">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple
   and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst?
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-17" id="en-NIV-28428">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-18" id="en-NIV-28429">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise
   by the standards of this age,
   you should become “fools” so that you may become wise.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-19" id="en-NIV-28430">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19
   </sup>
   For the wisdom of this world is foolishness
   in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”
   ;
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-20" id="en-NIV-28431">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20

   and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-21" id="en-NIV-28432">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So then, no more boasting about human leaders!
   All things are yours,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-22" id="en-NIV-28433">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22
   </sup>
   whether Paul or Apollos
   or Cephas
   or the world or life or death or the present or the future
   —all are yours,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-3-23" id="en-NIV-28434">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23
   </sup>
   and you are of Christ,
   and Christ is of God.
