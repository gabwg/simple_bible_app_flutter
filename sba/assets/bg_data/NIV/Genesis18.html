   The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   appeared to Abraham
   near the great trees of Mamre
   while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent
   in the heat of the day.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-2" id="en-NIV-427">

   Abraham looked up
   and saw three men
   standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-3" id="en-NIV-428">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes,
   my lord,
   do not pass your servant
   by.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-4" id="en-NIV-429">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet
   and rest under this tree.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-5" id="en-NIV-430">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   Let me get you something to eat,
   so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-5">
   “Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-6" id="en-NIV-431">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs
   of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-7" id="en-NIV-432">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf
   and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-8" id="en-NIV-433">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   He then brought some curds
   and milk
   and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them.
   While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-9" id="en-NIV-434">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “Where is your wife Sarah?”
   they asked him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-9">
   “There, in the tent,
   ” he said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-10" id="en-NIV-435">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10

   Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year,
   and Sarah your wife will have a son.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-10">
   Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-11" id="en-NIV-436">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11

   Abraham and Sarah were already very old,
   and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-12" id="en-NIV-437">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   So Sarah laughed
   to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord
   is old, will I now have this pleasure?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-13" id="en-NIV-438">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-14" id="en-NIV-439">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Is anything too hard for the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ?
   I will return to you at the appointed time next year,
   and Sarah will have a son.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-15" id="en-NIV-440">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-15">
   But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”

  <span class="text Gen-18-16">

   When the men
   got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-17" id="en-NIV-442">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said, “Shall I hide from Abraham

  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-18" id="en-NIV-443">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation,
   and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-19" id="en-NIV-444">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For I have chosen him
   , so that he will direct his children
   and his household after him to keep the way of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   by doing what is right and just,
   so that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-20" id="en-NIV-445">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said, “The outcry against Sodom
   and Gomorrah is so great
   and their sin so grievous
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-21" id="en-NIV-446">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21

   that I will go down
   and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-22" id="en-NIV-447">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The men
   turned away and went toward Sodom,
   but Abraham remained standing before the

  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-23" id="en-NIV-448">

   Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-24" id="en-NIV-449">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24
   </sup>
   What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare
   the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-18-25" id="en-NIV-450">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25

   Far be it from you to do such a thing
   —to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous
   and the wicked alike.
   Far be it from you! Will not the Judge
   of all the earth do right?”

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-26" id="en-NIV-451">

   The

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-18-27" id="en-NIV-452">
