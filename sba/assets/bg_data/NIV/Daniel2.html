   Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream

 <p class="chapter-1">

   <span class="chapternum">

   </span>
   In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams;
   his mind was troubled
   and he could not sleep.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-2" id="en-NIV-21761">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   So the king summoned the magicians,
   enchanters, sorcerers
   and astrologers
   to tell him what he had dreamed.
   When they came in and stood before the king,
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-3" id="en-NIV-21762">
   <sup class="versenum">
    3
   </sup>
   he said to them, “I have had a dream that troubles
   me and I want to know what it means.
   ”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-2-4" id="en-NIV-21763">
   <sup class="versenum">
    4
   </sup>
   Then the astrologers answered the king,
   “May the king live forever!
   Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-2-5" id="en-NIV-21764">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   The king replied to the astrologers, “This is what I have firmly decided:
   If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces
   and your houses turned into piles of rubble.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-6" id="en-NIV-21765">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor.
   So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-2-7" id="en-NIV-21766">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   Once more they replied, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-2-8" id="en-NIV-21767">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   Then the king answered, “I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-9" id="en-NIV-21768">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one penalty
   for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-2-10" id="en-NIV-21769">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   The astrologers
   answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-11" id="en-NIV-21770">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods,
   and they do not live among humans.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-2-12" id="en-NIV-21771">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   This made the king so angry and furious
   that he ordered the execution
   of all the wise men of Babylon.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-13" id="en-NIV-21772">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-2-14" id="en-NIV-21773">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-15" id="en-NIV-21774">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   He asked the king’s officer, “Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-16" id="en-NIV-21775">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-2-17" id="en-NIV-21776">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17

   Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-18" id="en-NIV-21777">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   He urged them to plead for mercy
   from the God of heaven
   concerning this mystery,
   so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-2-19" id="en-NIV-21778">
   <sup class="versenum">

   During the night the mystery

   but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries.
   He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come.
   Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind
