   Then the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   came to Jonah
   a second time:
  </span>
  <span class="text Jonah-3-2" id="en-NIV-22561">

   “Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.”

  <span class="text Jonah-3-3" id="en-NIV-22562">

   Jonah obeyed the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jonah-3-4" id="en-NIV-22563">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming,
   “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.”

  <span class="text Jonah-3-5" id="en-NIV-22564">

   The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.

   When Jonah’s warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jonah-3-7" id="en-NIV-22566">
   <sup class="versenum">

   This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh:
  </span>
 </p>
 <div class="left-1 child-first-line-1 top-05">
  <p class="first-line-none">
   <span class="text Jonah-3-7">
    “By the decree of the king and his nobles:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="top-05">
   <span class="text Jonah-3-7">
    Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink.

   <span class="text Jonah-3-8" id="en-NIV-22567">

    But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call
    urgently on God. Let them give up
    their evil ways
    and their violence.

   <span class="text Jonah-3-9" id="en-NIV-22568">

    Who knows?
    God may yet relent
    and with compassion turn
    from his fierce anger
    so that we will not perish.”

   When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented
   and did not bring on them the destruction
   he had threatened.
