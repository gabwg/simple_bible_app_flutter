   In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles
   by the Kebar River,
   the heavens were opened
   and I saw visions
   of God.

   On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin
   —

   the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   came to Ezekiel
   the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.
   There the hand of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   was on him.

   I looked, and I saw a windstorm
   coming out of the north
   —an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-5" id="en-NIV-20470">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures.
   In appearance their form was human,
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-6" id="en-NIV-20471">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   but each of them had four faces
   and four wings.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-7" id="en-NIV-20472">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7

   Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-8" id="en-NIV-20473">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands.
   All four of them had faces and wings,
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-9" id="en-NIV-20474">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-10" id="en-NIV-20475">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-11" id="en-NIV-20476">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   Such were their faces. They each had two wings
   spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-12" id="en-NIV-20477">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12

   Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-13" id="en-NIV-20478">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals
   of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning
   flashed out of it.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-14" id="en-NIV-20479">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.

   As I looked at the living creatures,
   I saw a wheel
   on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-16" id="en-NIV-20481">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz,
   and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-17" id="en-NIV-20482">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction
   as the creatures went.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-18" id="en-NIV-20483">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes
   all around.

  <span class="text Ezek-1-19" id="en-NIV-20484">

   When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-20" id="en-NIV-20485">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20

   Wherever the spirit would go, they would go,
   and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-21" id="en-NIV-20486">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21

   When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-22" id="en-NIV-20487">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault,
   sparkling like crystal, and awesome.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-23" id="en-NIV-20488">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23

   Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-24" id="en-NIV-20489">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24

   When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing
   waters, like the voice
   of the Almighty,
   like the tumult of an army.
   When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-25" id="en-NIV-20490">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-26" id="en-NIV-20491">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26

   Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne
   of lapis lazuli,
   and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-27" id="en-NIV-20492">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.

  <span class="text Ezek-1-28" id="en-NIV-20493">

   Like the appearance of a rainbow
   in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.

 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-1-28">
   This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory
   of the

   and I heard the voice of one speaking.
