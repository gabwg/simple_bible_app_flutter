   Dear friends,
   do not believe every spirit,
   but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

   This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
   is from God,

  <span class="text 1John-4-3" id="en-NIV-30607">

   but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist,
   which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.

   You, dear children,
   are from God and have overcome them,
   because the one who is in you
   is greater than the one who is in the world.

   We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us.
   This is how we recognize the Spirit
   of truth
   and the spirit of falsehood.

   Dear friends, let us love one another,

   and knows God.

  <span class="text 1John-4-10" id="en-NIV-30614">

   since God so loved us,

   No one has ever seen God;

   Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister
