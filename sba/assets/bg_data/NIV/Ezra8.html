   I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava,

   So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning,

   and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants
   in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God.

   Because the gracious hand of our God was on us,

   There, by the Ahava Canal,
   I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey

   I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers
   and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The gracious hand of our God is on everyone

   I said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the

   On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out

   Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls
