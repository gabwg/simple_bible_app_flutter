   My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious

   Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.

   If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,”

   Listen, my dear brothers and sisters:
   Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world
   to be rich in faith
   and to inherit the kingdom
   he promised those who love him?
  </span>
  <span class="text Jas-2-6" id="en-NIV-30300">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But you have dishonored the poor.
   Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
  </span>
  <span class="text Jas-2-7" id="en-NIV-30301">

   Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?

   If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,”
   you are doing right.

   But if you show favoritism,
   you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jas-2-10" id="en-NIV-30304">

   at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.

   For he who said, “You shall not commit adultery,”
   also said, “You shall not murder.”
   If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.

   What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?
   Can such faith save them?

   Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
