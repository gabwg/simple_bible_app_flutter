   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid;
   do not be discouraged.
   Take the whole army
   with you, and go up and attack Ai.
   For I have delivered
   into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-2" id="en-NIV-6005">
   <sup class="versenum">

   You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder
   and livestock for yourselves.
   Set an ambush
   behind the city.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-8-3" id="en-NIV-6006">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-4" id="en-NIV-6007">
   <sup class="versenum">
    4
   </sup>
   with these orders: “Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don’t go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-5" id="en-NIV-6008">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-6" id="en-NIV-6009">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are running away from us as they did before.’ So when we flee from them,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-7" id="en-NIV-6010">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God will give it into your hand.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-8" id="en-NIV-6011">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   When you have taken the city, set it on fire.
   Do what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has commanded.
   See to it; you have my orders.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-8-9" id="en-NIV-6012">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush
   and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai—but Joshua spent that night with the people.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-8-10" id="en-NIV-6013">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   Early the next morning
   Joshua mustered his army, and he and the leaders of Israel
   marched before them to Ai.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-11" id="en-NIV-6014">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-12" id="en-NIV-6015">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-13" id="en-NIV-6016">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   So the soldiers took up their positions—with the main camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-8-14" id="en-NIV-6017">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah.
   But he did not know
   that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-15" id="en-NIV-6018">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back
   before them, and they fled toward the wilderness.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-16" id="en-NIV-6019">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away
   from the city.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-17" id="en-NIV-6020">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-8-18" id="en-NIV-6021">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18
   </sup>
   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Joshua, “Hold out toward Ai the javelin
   that is in your hand,
   for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin that was in his hand.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-19" id="en-NIV-6022">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19
   </sup>
   As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly
   from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-8-20" id="en-NIV-6023">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising up into the sky,
   but they had no chance to escape in any direction; the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the wilderness had turned back against their pursuers.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-21" id="en-NIV-6024">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21
   </sup>
   For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from it, they turned around
   and attacked the men of Ai.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-22" id="en-NIV-6025">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22
   </sup>
   Those in the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-23" id="en-NIV-6026">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23
   </sup>
   But they took the king of Ai alive
   and brought him to Joshua.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-8-24" id="en-NIV-6027">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24
   </sup>
   When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-25" id="en-NIV-6028">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25
   </sup>
   Twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-26" id="en-NIV-6029">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26
   </sup>
   For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin
   until he had destroyed
   all who lived in Ai.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-27" id="en-NIV-6030">
   <sup class="versenum">
    27
   </sup>
   But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had instructed Joshua.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-8-28" id="en-NIV-6031">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Joshua burned
   Ai
   and made it a permanent heap of ruins,
   a desolate place to this day.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-29" id="en-NIV-6032">
   <sup class="versenum">
    29
   </sup>
   He impaled the body of the king of Ai on a pole and left it there until evening. At sunset,
   Joshua ordered them to take the body from the pole and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks
   over it, which remains to this day.

   Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal
   an altar

   as Moses the servant of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses—an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool
   had been used. On it they offered to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-8-32" id="en-NIV-6035">
   <sup class="versenum">

   There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses.

  <span class="text Josh-8-33" id="en-NIV-6036">
   <sup class="versenum">
    33

   All the Israelites, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , facing the Levitical
   priests who carried it. Both the foreigners living among them and the native-born
   were there. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal,
   as Moses the servant of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>

   Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—just as it is written in the Book of the Law.

  <span class="text Josh-8-35" id="en-NIV-6038">

   There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the foreigners who lived among them.
