   In the course of time, David inquired
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

  <span class="text 2Sam-2-1">
   The

   David asked, “Where shall I go?”

   So David went up there with his two wives,
   Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail,
   the widow of Nabal of Carmel.

   David also took the men who were with him,

   Then the men of Judah came to Hebron,

   David king over the tribe of Judah.

   When David was told that it was the men from Jabesh Gilead

  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-5" id="en-NIV-8055">
   <sup class="versenum">

   he sent messengers to them to say to them, “The

   May the

   Meanwhile, Abner
   son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth
   son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-9" id="en-NIV-8059">

   He made him king over Gilead,
   Ashuri

  <span class="text 2Sam-2-10" id="en-NIV-8060">

   Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The tribe of Judah, however, remained loyal to David.

   The length of time David was king in Hebron over Judah was seven years and six months.

  <span class="text 2Sam-2-12" id="en-NIV-8062">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.

   Joab
   son of Zeruiah and David’s men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-14" id="en-NIV-8064">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14

   Then Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-14">
   “All right, let them do it,” Joab said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-15" id="en-NIV-8065">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So they stood up and were counted off—twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.

  <span class="text 2Sam-2-16" id="en-NIV-8066">

   Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger
   into his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-17" id="en-NIV-8067">

   The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated
   by David’s men.

   The three sons of Zeruiah
   were there: Joab,
   Abishai
   and Asahel.
   Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.

   He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-20" id="en-NIV-8070">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20

   Abner looked behind him and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-20">
   “It is,” he answered.

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-21" id="en-NIV-8071">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Abner said to him, “Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-22" id="en-NIV-8072">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22

   Again Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?”

   But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel’s stomach,
   and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.

  <span class="text 2Sam-2-24" id="en-NIV-8074">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-25" id="en-NIV-8075">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-26" id="en-NIV-8076">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26

   Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour
   forever? Don’t you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their fellow Israelites?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-27" id="en-NIV-8077">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Joab answered, “As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued pursuing them until morning.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-28" id="en-NIV-8078">
   <sup class="versenum">
    28

   So Joab
   blew the trumpet,
   and all the troops came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-29" id="en-NIV-8079">

   All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah.
   They crossed the Jordan, continued through the morning hours
   and came to Mahanaim.

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-2-30" id="en-NIV-8080">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Joab stopped pursuing Abner and assembled the whole army. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David’s men were found missing.

   They took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb
   at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
