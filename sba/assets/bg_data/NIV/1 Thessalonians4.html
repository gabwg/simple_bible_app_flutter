   As for other matters, brothers and sisters,
   we instructed you how to live
   in order to please God,
   as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-2" id="en-NIV-29606">

   For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.

   It is God’s will
   that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality;
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-4" id="en-NIV-29608">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   that each of you should learn to control your own body
   in a way that is holy and honorable,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-5" id="en-NIV-29609">
   <sup class="versenum">

   not in passionate lust
   like the pagans,
   who do not know God;
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-6" id="en-NIV-29610">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.
   The Lord will punish
   all those who commit such sins,
   as we told you and warned you before.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-7" id="en-NIV-29611">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.

  <span class="text 1Thess-4-8" id="en-NIV-29612">

   Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.

   Now about your love for one another
   we do not need to write to you,
   for you yourselves have been taught by God
   to love each other.

  <span class="text 1Thess-4-10" id="en-NIV-29614">

   And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia.
   Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-11" id="en-NIV-29615">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11

   and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands,
   just as we told you,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-12" id="en-NIV-29616">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Believers Who Have Died

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-13">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed
   about those who sleep in death,
   so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-14" id="en-NIV-29618">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
   and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-15" id="en-NIV-29619">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord,
   will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-16" id="en-NIV-29620">

   For the Lord himself will come down from heaven,
   with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel
   and with the trumpet call of God,
   and the dead in Christ will rise first.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-4-17" id="en-NIV-29621">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   After that, we who are still alive and are left
   will be caught up together with them in the clouds
   to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord
   forever.

  <span class="text 1Thess-4-18" id="en-NIV-29622">

   Therefore encourage one another
   with these words.
