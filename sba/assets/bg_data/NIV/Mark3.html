   Another time Jesus went into the synagogue,

   Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely
   to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.

   Then Jesus asked them,

    “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?”

   He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man,
   <span class="woj">
    “Stretch out your hand.”

   He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
