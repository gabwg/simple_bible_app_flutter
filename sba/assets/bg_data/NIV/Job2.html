   On another day the angels
   came to present themselves before the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   to present himself before him.

   And the

 <p>
  <span class="text Job-2-2">
   Satan answered the

   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.
   And he still maintains his integrity,
   though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.”

   “Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has

   So Satan went out from the presence of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   He replied, “You are talking like a foolish

   When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite,
   Bildad the Shuhite
   and Zophar the Naamathite,
   heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.

   When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him;
   they began to weep aloud,
   and they tore their robes
   and sprinkled dust on their heads.

   with him for seven days and seven nights.
   No one said a word to him,
   because they saw how great his suffering was.
