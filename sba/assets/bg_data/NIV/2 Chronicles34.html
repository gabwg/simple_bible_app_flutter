   He did what was right in the eyes of the

   In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God
   of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles and idols.

   Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles
   and the idols. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
