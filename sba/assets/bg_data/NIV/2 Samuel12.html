   The

    Lord
   </span>
   sent Nathan
   to David.
   When he came to him,
   he said, “There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-12-2" id="en-NIV-8289">

   The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-12-3" id="en-NIV-8290">
   <sup class="versenum">

   but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.

  <span class="text 2Sam-12-4" id="en-NIV-8291">

   “Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”

  <span class="text 2Sam-12-5" id="en-NIV-8292">

   David
   burned with anger
   against the man
   and said to Nathan, “As surely as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   the man who did this must die!

  <span class="text 2Sam-12-6" id="en-NIV-8293">

   He must pay for that lamb four times over,
   because he did such a thing and had no pity.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-12-7" id="en-NIV-8294">

   Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man!
   This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   , the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed

   I gave your master’s house to you,

   Why did you despise
   the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down
   Uriah
   the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed
   him with the sword of the Ammonites.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-12-10" id="en-NIV-8297">

   Now, therefore, the sword

   “This is what the

   says: ‘Out of your own household

   Nathan replied, “The

   After Nathan had gone home, the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   </span>
   struck
   the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and he became ill.

  <span class="text 2Sam-12-16" id="en-NIV-8303">
   <sup class="versenum">

   David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying
   in sackcloth
   on the ground.

   The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused,

   On the seventh day the child died. David’s attendants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, “While the child was still living, he wouldn’t listen to us when we spoke to him. How can we now tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-12-19" id="en-NIV-8306">

   David noticed that his attendants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child was dead. “Is the child dead?” he asked.

  <span class="text 2Sam-12-19">
   “Yes,” they replied, “he is dead.”

   Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed,
   put on lotions and changed his clothes,
   he went into the house of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   His attendants asked him, “Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept,

  <span class="text 2Sam-12-22" id="en-NIV-8309">

   He answered, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, ‘Who knows?

   Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba,

   The

   Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, “I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply.

   Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me.”

   David took the crown

   David did this to all the Ammonite
   towns. Then he and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
