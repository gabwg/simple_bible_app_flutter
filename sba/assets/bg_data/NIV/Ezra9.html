   After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate
   from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites,
   Ammonites,
   Moabites,
   Egyptians and Amorites.

   They have taken some of their daughters
   as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled
   the holy race
   with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.”

   When I heard this, I tore

   Then everyone who trembled
   at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled
   until the evening sacrifice.

   Then, at the evening sacrifice,
   I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands

    From the days of our ancestors
    until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword
    and captivity,
    to pillage and humiliation
    at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.

    Though we are slaves,
    our God has not forsaken us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness
    in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins,
    and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.

    Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them

    of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.’

    Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry
