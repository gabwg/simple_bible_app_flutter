   All the tribes of Israel

   When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a covenant
   with them at Hebron before the

   David was thirty years old

   The king and his men marched to Jerusalem
   to attack the Jebusites,
   who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, “You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off.” They thought, “David cannot get in here.”

   Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion

   On that day David had said, “Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft
   to reach those ‘lame and blind’
   who are David’s enemies.
   ” That is why they say, “The ‘blind and lame’ will not enter the palace.”

   David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the terraces

   Now Hiram

   Then David knew that the

   When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.

   so David inquired

   The

   So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, the

   has broken out against my enemies before me.” So that place was called Baal Perazim.

   The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.

   Once more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;

   As soon as you hear the sound

    Lord

   all the way from Gibeon
