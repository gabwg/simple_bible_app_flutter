   On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt
   —on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-19-2" id="en-NIV-2029">

   After they set out from Rephidim,
   they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.

   Then Moses went up to God,
   and the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   called
   to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-19-4" id="en-NIV-2031">
   <sup class="versenum">

   ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt,
   and how I carried you on eagles’ wings
   and brought you to myself.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-19-5" id="en-NIV-2032">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   Now if you obey me fully
   and keep my covenant,
   then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession.
   Although the whole earth
   is mine,
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-19-6" id="en-NIV-2033">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6

   you
   will be for me a kingdom of priests
   and a holy nation.’
   These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-19-7" id="en-NIV-2034">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Moses went back and summoned the elders
   of the people and set before them all the words the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   had commanded him to speak.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-19-8" id="en-NIV-2035">

   The people all responded together, “We will do everything the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has said.”
   So Moses brought their answer back to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   The

    Lord

   said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud,
   so that the people will hear me speaking
   with you and will always put their trust
   in you.” Then Moses told the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   what the people had said.

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-19-10" id="en-NIV-2037">

   And the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate

   and be ready by the third day,
   because on that day the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   on Mount Sinai
   in the sight of all the people.

   Put limits
   for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death.

   They are to be stoned
   or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn
   sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.”

   After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.

  <span class="text Exod-19-15" id="en-NIV-2042">

   On the morning of the third day there was thunder
   and lightning, with a thick cloud
   over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast.
   Everyone in the camp trembled.

  <span class="text Exod-19-17" id="en-NIV-2044">

   Mount Sinai was covered with smoke,
   because the

   descended on it in fire.
   The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace,

   violently.
