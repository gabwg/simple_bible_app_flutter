   Now Jethro,
   the priest of Midian
   and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had brought Israel out of Egypt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-18-2" id="en-NIV-2002">

   After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah,
   his father-in-law Jethro received her
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-18-3" id="en-NIV-2003">
   <sup class="versenum">
    3
   </sup>
   and her two sons.
   One son was named Gershom,
   for Moses said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land”;
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-18-4" id="en-NIV-2004">
   <sup class="versenum">
    4

   and the other was named Eliezer,
   for he said, “My father’s God was my helper;
   he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-18-5" id="en-NIV-2005">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain
   of God.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-18-6" id="en-NIV-2006">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Jethro had sent word to him, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-18-7" id="en-NIV-2007">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down
   and kissed
   him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-18-8" id="en-NIV-2008">

   Moses told his father-in-law about everything the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake and about all the hardships
   they had met along the way and how the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   had saved
   them.

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-18-9" id="en-NIV-2009">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things
   the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-18-10" id="en-NIV-2010">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10

   He said, “Praise be to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ,
   who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-18-11" id="en-NIV-2011">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   Now I know that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   is greater than all other gods,
   for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-18-12" id="en-NIV-2012">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12

   Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law,
   brought a burnt offering
   and other sacrifices
   to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal
   with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence
   of God.

   The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-18-14" id="en-NIV-2014">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, “What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-18-15" id="en-NIV-2015">

   Moses answered him, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will.

   Whenever they have a dispute,
   it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God’s decrees and instructions.”

  <span class="text Exod-18-17" id="en-NIV-2017">

   Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good.

   You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.

   <sup class="versenum">
    19

   Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you.
   You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes

   Teach them his decrees and instructions,

   But select capable men
   from all the people—men who fear
   God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain

   Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case
   to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share
   it with you.
