   But to Jonah this seemed very wrong, and he became angry.

   He prayed to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , “Isn’t this what I said,
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew
   that you are a gracious
   and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love,
   a God who relents
   from sending calamity.

   Now,
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   for it is better for me to die
   than to live.”

   Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city.

   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   God provided
   a leafy plant
   and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant.

   When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah’s head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die,
   and said, “It would be better for me to die than to live.”

   And should I not have concern
   for the great city of Nineveh,
   in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?”
