   Now a man named Micah
   from the hill country of Ephraim
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-17-2" id="en-NIV-6983">

   said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels
   of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have that silver with me; I took it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-17-2">
   Then his mother said, “The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   bless you,
   my son!”
  </span>
 </p>

  <span class="text Judg-17-3" id="en-NIV-6984">

   When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I solemnly consecrate my silver to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   for my son to make an image overlaid with silver.
   I will give it back to you.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-17-4" id="en-NIV-6985">

   So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels
   of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used them to make the idol.
   And it was put in Micah’s house.

   Now this man Micah had a shrine,
   and he made an ephod
   and some household gods
   and installed
   one of his sons as his priest.
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-17-6" id="en-NIV-6987">

   In those days Israel had no king;
   everyone did as they saw fit.

   A young Levite
   from Bethlehem in Judah,
   who had been living within the clan of Judah,
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-17-8" id="en-NIV-6989">
   <sup class="versenum">

   left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way
   he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-17-9" id="en-NIV-6990">

   Micah asked him, “Where are you from?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-17-9">
   “I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,
   ” he said, “and I’m looking for a place to stay.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-17-10" id="en-NIV-6991">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Micah said to him, “Live with me and be my father
   and priest,
   and I’ll give you ten shekels
   of silver a year, your clothes and your food.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-17-11" id="en-NIV-6992">

   So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-17-12" id="en-NIV-6993">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Micah installed
   the Levite, and the young man became his priest
   and lived in his house.
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-17-13" id="en-NIV-6994">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And Micah said, “Now I know that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest.”
