   Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth
   the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel,
   close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-21-2" id="en-NIV-9454">

   Ahab said to Naboth, “Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-21-3" id="en-NIV-9455">

   But Naboth replied, “The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   forbid that I should give you the inheritance
   of my ancestors.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-21-4" id="en-NIV-9456">

   So Ahab went home, sullen and angry
   because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors.” He lay on his bed sulking and refused
   to eat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-21-5" id="en-NIV-9457">

   His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, “Why are you so sullen? Why won’t you eat?”

  <span class="text 1Kgs-21-6" id="en-NIV-9458">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He answered her, “Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, ‘Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-21-7" id="en-NIV-9459">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Jezebel his wife said, “Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I’ll get you the vineyard
   of Naboth the Jezreelite.”

   So she wrote letters
   in Ahab’s name, placed his seal
   on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city with him.

   In those letters she wrote:

  <span class="text 1Kgs-21-12" id="en-NIV-9464">

   Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed both God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.

  <span class="text 1Kgs-21-14" id="en-NIV-9466">

   As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of the vineyard
