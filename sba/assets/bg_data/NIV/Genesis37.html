   Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed,
   the land of Canaan.

   This is the account

 <p class="top-05">
  <span class="text Gen-37-2">
   Joseph,
   a young man of seventeen,
   was tending the flocks
   with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah
   and the sons of Zilpah,
   his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad report
   about them.

  <span class="text Gen-37-3" id="en-NIV-1087">

   Now Israel
   loved Joseph more than any of his other sons,
   because he had been born to him in his old age;
   and he made an ornate
   robe
   for him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-37-4" id="en-NIV-1088">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him
   and could not speak a kind word to him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-37-5" id="en-NIV-1089">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Joseph had a dream,
   and when he told it to his brothers,
   they hated him all the more.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-37-6" id="en-NIV-1090">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6

   He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-37-7" id="en-NIV-1091">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   We were binding sheaves
   of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-37-8" id="en-NIV-1092">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8

   His brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?”
   And they hated him all the more
   because of his dream and what he had said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-37-9" id="en-NIV-1093">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   Then he had another dream,
   and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars
   were bowing down to me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-37-10" id="en-NIV-1094">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10

   When he told his father as well as his brothers,
   his father rebuked
   him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-37-11" id="en-NIV-1095">

   His brothers were jealous of him,
   but his father kept the matter in mind.

   Now his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-37-13" id="en-NIV-1097">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   and Israel
   said to Joseph, “As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem.
   Come, I am going to send you to them.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-37-13">
   “Very well,” he replied.

  <span class="text Gen-37-14" id="en-NIV-1098">

   So he said to him, “Go and see if all is well with your brothers
   and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.” Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-37-14">

  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-37-15" id="en-NIV-1099">

   a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?”

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-37-16" id="en-NIV-1100">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?”

   “They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.

  <span class="text Gen-37-17">
   So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.

   When Reuben

   “Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern
   here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.

   So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe

  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-37-24" id="en-NIV-1108">
   <sup class="versenum">

   As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites
   coming from Gilead.
   Their camels were loaded with spices, balm
   and myrrh,
   and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.

   Judah

   Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother,

   So when the Midianite
   merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern
   and sold
   him for twenty shekels
   of silver
   to the Ishmaelites,
   who took him to Egypt.

   Then they got Joseph’s robe,
   slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-37-32" id="en-NIV-1116">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They took the ornate robe
   back to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.”

   All his sons and daughters came to comfort him,

   Meanwhile, the Midianites
   sold Joseph
