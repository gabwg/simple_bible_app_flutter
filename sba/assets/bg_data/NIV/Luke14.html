   One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee,
   he was being carefully watched.

   Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law,
   <span class="woj">
    “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”

  <span class="text Luke-14-4" id="en-NIV-25558">

  <span class="text Luke-14-5" id="en-NIV-25559">

   When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table,
   he told them this parable:

  <span class="text Luke-14-8" id="en-NIV-25562">
   <span class="woj">
