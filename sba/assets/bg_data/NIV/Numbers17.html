   “Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs

   On the staff of Levi write Aaron’s name,

   So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron’s staff was among them.

   Moses placed the staffs before the

   The next day Moses entered the tent
   and saw that Aaron’s staff,
   which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds.

   Then Moses brought out all the staffs
