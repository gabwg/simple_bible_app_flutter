   The company

   Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to meet.”

   And he went with them.

  <span class="text 2Kgs-6-4">
   They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees.

   As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. “Oh no, my lord!” he cried out. “It was borrowed!”

   The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw
   it there, and made the iron float.

   Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, “I will set up my camp in such and such a place.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-6-9" id="en-NIV-9684">

   The man of God sent word to the king

   So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned

   Then he sent

   When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked.

   As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the

   So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.

   Elisha told them, “This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.” And he led them to Samaria.

   “Do not kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill those you have captured

   Some time later, Ben-Hadad

   There was a great famine

   When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore
   his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and they saw that, under his robes, he had sackcloth
   on his body.

   Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders

   is sending someone to cut off my head?
   Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?”
