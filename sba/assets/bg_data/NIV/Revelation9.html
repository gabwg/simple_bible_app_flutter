   The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth.
   The star was given the key
   to the shaft of the Abyss.

   When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace.
   The sun and sky were darkened
   by the smoke from the Abyss.

   They were told not to harm
   the grass of the earth or any plant or tree,

   They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months.

   The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle.

   The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns

   The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent
