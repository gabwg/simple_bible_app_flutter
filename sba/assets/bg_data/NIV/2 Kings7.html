   Elisha replied, “Hear the word of the

   says: About this time tomorrow, a seah

   The officer on whose arm the king was leaning
   said to the man of God, “Look, even if the

   Now there were four men with leprosy
   at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, “Why stay here until we die?

  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-4" id="en-NIV-9712">

   If we say, ‘We’ll go into the city’—the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let’s go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die.”

   At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, no one was there,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-6" id="en-NIV-9714">
   <sup class="versenum">

   for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound
   of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired
   the Hittite
   and Egyptian kings to attack us!”
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-7" id="en-NIV-9715">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So they got up and fled
   in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.

   The men who had leprosy
   reached the edge of the camp, entered one of the tents and ate and drank. Then they took silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.

  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-9" id="en-NIV-9717">

   Then they said to each other, “What we’re doing is not right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let’s go at once and report this to the royal palace.”

  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-10" id="en-NIV-9718">

   So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, “We went into the Aramean camp and no one was there—not a sound of anyone—only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-11" id="en-NIV-9719">

   The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.

   The king got up in the night and said to his officers, “I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide
   in the countryside, thinking, ‘They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.’”

  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-13" id="en-NIV-9721">

   One of his officers answered, “Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here—yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened.”

  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-14" id="en-NIV-9722">

   So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, “Go and find out what has happened.”

  <span class="text 2Kgs-7-15" id="en-NIV-9723">

   They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight.
   So the messengers returned and reported to the king.

   Then the people went out and plundered
   the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of the finest flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel,
   as the

   Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died,

   It happened as the man of God had said to the king: “About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.”
