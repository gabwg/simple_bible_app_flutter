   The word came to Jeremiah from the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah.
   He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives
   from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon.

   When the commander
   of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, “The

   your God decreed
   this disaster

   And now the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has brought it about; he has done just as he said he would. All this happened because you people sinned
   against the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   and did not obey
   him.

  <span class="text Jer-40-4" id="en-NIV-19946">

   But today I am freeing
   you from the chains
   on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to, then don’t come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please.”

   However, before Jeremiah turned to go,
   Nebuzaradan added, “Go back to Gedaliah
   son of Ahikam,
   the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed
   over the towns
   of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please.”

   Then the commander gave him provisions and a present

   When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor
   over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest

   they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah

   Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be afraid to serve
   the Babylonians,

   I myself will stay at Mizpah

   When all the Jews in Moab,

   heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them,

   they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered.

   Then Johanan
   son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, “Let me go and kill
   Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered
   and the remnant
   of Judah to perish?”
