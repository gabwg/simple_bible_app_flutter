   In the spring,
   at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab
   out with the king’s men and the whole Israelite army.
   They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah.
   But David remained in Jerusalem.

   One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof
   of the palace. From the roof he saw
   a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,

   She came to him, and he slept

   Then she went back home.

   Uriah said to David, “The ark
   and Israel and Judah are staying in tents,
   and my commander Joab and my lord’s men are camped in the open country. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and make love
   to my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!”
