   In the fourth year of Jehoiakim
   son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   “Take a scroll
   and write on it all the words
   I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah
   till now.

   Perhaps
   when the people of Judah hear
   about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn
   from their wicked ways; then I will forgive
   their wickedness and their sin.”

  <span class="text Jer-36-4" id="en-NIV-19847">

   So Jeremiah called Baruch
   son of Neriah,
   and while Jeremiah dictated
   all the words the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll.

   Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the

   and read to the people from the scroll the words of the

   Read them to all the people of Judah

   from their wicked ways, for the anger

   Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the

   In the ninth month

   From the room of Gemariah
   son of Shaphan
   the secretary,
   which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate
   of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the

   he went down to the secretary’s
   room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan
   son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.

  <span class="text Jer-36-14" id="en-NIV-19857">

   all the officials sent Jehudi
   son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll
   from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-36-15" id="en-NIV-19858">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.”

   When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear

  <span class="text Jer-36-17" id="en-NIV-19860">
   <sup class="versenum">

   After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him.

   The king sent Jehudi

   It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment,

   Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll,
   the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire.

   The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear,

   Even though Elnathan, Delaiah

   Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest
   Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the

   After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation,
   the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   came to Jeremiah:
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-36-28" id="en-NIV-19871">
   <sup class="versenum">
    28

   “Take another scroll
   and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-36-29" id="en-NIV-19872">
   <sup class="versenum">
    29
   </sup>
   Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   says: You burned that scroll and said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it
   both man and beast?”
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-36-30" id="en-NIV-19873">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Therefore this is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   says about Jehoiakim
   king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out
   and exposed
   to the heat by day and the frost by night.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-36-31" id="en-NIV-19874">
   <sup class="versenum">
    31

   I will punish him and his children
   and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster
   I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.

  <span class="text Jer-36-32" id="en-NIV-19875">

   So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated,
   Baruch wrote
   on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned
   in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
