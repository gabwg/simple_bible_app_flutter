   As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,

   All of us also lived among them at one time,
   gratifying the cravings of our flesh
   and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.

  <span class="text Eph-2-6" id="en-NIV-29236">

   And God raised us up with Christ

  <span class="text Eph-2-7" id="en-NIV-29237">

   Therefore, remember that formerly

   remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners

   and without God in the world.
