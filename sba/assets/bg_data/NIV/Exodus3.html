   Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro
   his father-in-law, the priest of Midian,
   and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb,
   the mountain
   of God.

   There the angel of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   appeared to him in flames of fire
   from within a bush.
   Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-3-3" id="en-NIV-1583">

   So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.”

   When the

   saw that he had gone over to look, God called
   to him from within the bush,
   “Moses! Moses!”

   Then he said, “I am the God of your father,
   the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.”
   At this, Moses hid
   his face, because he was afraid to look at God.

   The

   said, “I have indeed seen
   the misery

   So I have come down
   to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land,
   a land flowing with milk and honey
