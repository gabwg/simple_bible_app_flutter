   Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged
   your father, that he is trying to kill me?”

   “Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn’t so!”

   But David took an oath
   and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely as the

   If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission

   If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper,

   Then Jonathan said to David, “I swear by the

   Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the

   So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon feast

   He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan,

   Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.

   But the next day, the second day of the month, David’s place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”

   He said, ‘Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice

   Saul’s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?

   In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,
