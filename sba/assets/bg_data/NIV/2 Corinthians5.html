   For we know that if the earthly
   tent
   we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-5-2" id="en-NIV-28880">

   Meanwhile we groan,
   longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-5-3" id="en-NIV-28881">
   <sup class="versenum">

   because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-5-4" id="en-NIV-28882">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   For while we are in this tent, we groan
   and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling,
   so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-5-5" id="en-NIV-28883">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.

  <span class="text 2Cor-5-6" id="en-NIV-28884">

   Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.

  <span class="text 2Cor-5-7" id="en-NIV-28885">

   We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-5-9" id="en-NIV-28887">

   So we make it our goal to please him,
   whether we are at home in the body or away from it.

  <span class="text 2Cor-5-10" id="en-NIV-28888">

   For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us
   for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.

   Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord,
   we try to persuade others. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.

   We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again,
   but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us,
   so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.

   If we are “out of our mind,”
   as some say, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.

  <span class="text 2Cor-5-14" id="en-NIV-28892">

   For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.

  <span class="text 2Cor-5-15" id="en-NIV-28893">

   And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves
   but for him who died for them
   and was raised again.

   So from now on we regard no one from a worldly
   point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.

   Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
   the new creation
   has come:
   The old has gone, the new is here!

  <span class="text 2Cor-5-18" id="en-NIV-28896">
   <sup class="versenum">

   All this is from God,
   who reconciled us to himself through Christ
   and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-5-19" id="en-NIV-28897">
   <sup class="versenum">

   that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them.
   And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.

  <span class="text 2Cor-5-20" id="en-NIV-28898">
   <sup class="versenum">

   We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors,
   as though God were making his appeal through us.
   We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-5-21" id="en-NIV-28899">

   God made him who had no sin
   to be sin
   for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
