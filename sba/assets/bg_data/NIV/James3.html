   Not many of you should become teachers,
   my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged
   more strictly.

   We all stumble
   in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say
   is perfect,

   The tongue also is a fire,
   a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body,
   sets the whole course of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.
