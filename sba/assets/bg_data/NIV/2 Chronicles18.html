   Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor,
   and he allied
   himself with Ahab

   Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead.

   Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Chr-18-3">
   Jehoshaphat replied, “I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war.”

   But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “First seek the counsel of the

   So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Chr-18-5">
   “Go,” they answered, “for God will give it into the king’s hand.”

   The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   , but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.”

  <span class="text 2Chr-18-7">
   “The king should not say such a thing,” Jehoshaphat replied.

   Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.

   Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, “This is what the

   All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead
