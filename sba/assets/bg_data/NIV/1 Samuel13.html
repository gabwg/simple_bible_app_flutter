   Saul was thirty

   two years.

   Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand
   were with him at Mikmash
   and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah
   in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.

   Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost
   at Geba,
   and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet
   blown throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!”

   So all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious
   to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.

   The Philistines assembled
   to fight Israel, with three thousand
   chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand
   on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash,
   east of Beth Aven.

   When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid
   in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns.

   up the burnt offering.

   Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash,

   I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal,

   “You have done a foolish thing,

   the command the
