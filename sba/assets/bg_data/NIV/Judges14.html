   Samson
   went down to Timnah
   and saw there a young Philistine woman.

   When he returned, he said to his father and mother, “I have seen a Philistine woman in Timnah; now get her for me as my wife.”

   His father and mother replied, “Isn’t there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people?
   Must you go to the uncircumcised
   Philistines to get a wife?
   ”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-14-3">
   But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me. She’s the right one for me.”

   (His parents did not know that this was from the

   who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines;

   Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.

   The Spirit of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   came powerfully upon him
   so that he tore the lion apart
   with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done.
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-14-7" id="en-NIV-6917">

   Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her.

   Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion’s carcass, and in it he saw a swarm of bees and some honey.

   He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass.

   Now his father went down to see the woman. And there Samson held a feast,
   as was customary for young men.

   “Let me tell you a riddle,
   ” Samson said to them. “If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast,
   I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.

   On the fourth

   your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father’s household to death.
   Did you invite us here to steal our property?”

   Then Samson’s wife threw herself on him, sobbing, “You hate me! You don’t really love me.
   You’ve given my people a riddle, but you haven’t told me the answer.”

  <span class="text Judg-14-16">
   “I haven’t even explained it to my father or mother,” he replied, “so why should I explain it to you?”

   She cried the whole seven days
