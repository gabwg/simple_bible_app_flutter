   Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.

   A tabernacle
   was set up. In its first room were the lampstand
   and the table
   with its consecrated bread;
   this was called the Holy Place.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-3" id="en-NIV-30109">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-4" id="en-NIV-30110">

   which had the golden altar of incense
   and the gold-covered ark of the covenant.
   This ark contained the gold jar of manna,
   Aaron’s staff that had budded,
   and the stone tablets of the covenant.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-5" id="en-NIV-30111">

   Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory,
   overshadowing the atonement cover.
   But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.

   When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly
   into the outer room to carry on their ministry.

  <span class="text Heb-9-7" id="en-NIV-30113">

   But only the high priest entered
   the inner room,
   and that only once a year,
   and never without blood,
   which he offered for himself
   and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-8" id="en-NIV-30114">

   The Holy Spirit was showing
   by this that the way
   into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning.

   This is an illustration
   for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered
   were not able to clear the conscience

   But when Christ came as high priest
   of the good things that are now already here,
   he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle
   that is not made with human hands,
   that is to say, is not a part of this creation.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-12" id="en-NIV-30118">

   He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves;
   but he entered the Most Holy Place
   once for all
   by his own blood,
   thus obtaining
   eternal redemption.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-13" id="en-NIV-30119">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The blood of goats and bulls
   and the ashes of a heifer
   sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-14" id="en-NIV-30120">
   <sup class="versenum">

   How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
   offered himself
   unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences
   from acts that lead to death,
   so that we may serve the living God!

 <p>
  <span class="text Heb-9-15" id="en-NIV-30121">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For this reason Christ is the mediator
   of a new covenant,
   that those who are called
   may receive the promised
   eternal inheritance
   —now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.

   In the case of a will,
   it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-17" id="en-NIV-30123">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-18" id="en-NIV-30124">
   <sup class="versenum">

   This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.

   When Moses had proclaimed
   every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves,
   together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-20" id="en-NIV-30126">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”

  <span class="text Heb-9-21" id="en-NIV-30127">

   In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.

   In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood,
   and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

  <span class="text Heb-9-23" id="en-NIV-30129">

   It was necessary, then, for the copies
   of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-24" id="en-NIV-30130">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24
   </sup>
   For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one;
   he entered heaven itself,
   now to appear for us in God’s presence.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-25" id="en-NIV-30131">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25

   Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place
   every year with blood that is not his own.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-26" id="en-NIV-30132">

   Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world.
   But he has appeared
   once for all
   at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-27" id="en-NIV-30133">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Just as people are destined to die once,
   and after that to face judgment,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-9-28" id="en-NIV-30134">
   <sup class="versenum">
    28
   </sup>
   so Christ was sacrificed once
   to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time,
   not to bear sin,
   but to bring salvation
   to those who are waiting for him.
