   Now Haggai
   the prophet and Zechariah
   the prophet, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied
   to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.

   Then Zerubbabel
   son of Shealtiel and Joshua
   son of Jozadak set to work
   to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, supporting them.

   At that time Tattenai,
   governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai
   and their associates went to them and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and to finish it?”

   But the eye of their God
   was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received.

    The king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work
    is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction.

    We also asked them their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.

    This is the answer they gave us:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="top-05">
   <span class="text Ezra-5-11">
    “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple
    that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished.

    But because our ancestors angered
    the God of heaven, he gave them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.

    “However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree
    to rebuild this house of God.

    He even removed from the temple
    of Babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple
    in Babylon.
    Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar,
    whom he had appointed governor,

   <span class="text Ezra-5-15" id="en-NIV-12150">

    “So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God
    in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished.”

    Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives
    of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.
