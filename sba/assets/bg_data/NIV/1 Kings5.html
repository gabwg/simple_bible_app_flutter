   When Hiram
   king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David.

   Solomon sent back this message to Hiram:

    “You know that because of the wars
    waged against my father David from all sides, he could not build
    a temple for the Name of the
    <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

    his God until the

    But now the

    my God has given me rest

    I intend, therefore, to build a temple
    for the Name of the
    <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
     Lord
    </span>
    my God, as the
    <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

    told my father David, when he said, ‘Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.’

    “So give orders that cedars
    of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians.”

   When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he was greatly pleased and said, “Praise be to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   today, for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation.”

   So Hiram sent word to Solomon:

   <span class="text 1Kgs-5-8">
    “I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and juniper logs.

    <sup class="versenum">

    My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea
    , and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food
    for my royal household.”

  <span class="text 1Kgs-5-10" id="en-NIV-8889">

   In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and juniper logs he wanted,

  <span class="text 1Kgs-5-11" id="en-NIV-8890">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors
   of wheat as food
   for his household, in addition to twenty thousand baths
   of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year.

   The

   gave Solomon wisdom,
   just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.

   King Solomon conscripted laborers

   He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram
   was in charge of the forced labor.

   At the king’s command they removed from the quarry
   large blocks of high-grade stone
