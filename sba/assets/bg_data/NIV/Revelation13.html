   The dragon
   stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea.
   It had ten horns and seven heads,
   with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.

   The beast I saw resembled a leopard,
   but had feet like those of a bear
   and a mouth like that of a lion.
   The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.

   One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed.
   The whole world was filled with wonder
   and followed the beast.

   People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like
   the beast? Who can wage war against it?”

   Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth.
   It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.

   It exercised all the authority

   Because of the signs
   it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived
   the inhabitants of the earth.
   It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.

   The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship
   the image to be killed.

   It also forced all people, great and small,
   rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,

   This calls for wisdom.
   Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.
