   And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven,
   having the key
   to the Abyss

   He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan,

   He threw him into the Abyss,
   and locked and sealed
   it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations
   anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.

   I saw thrones
   on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge.
   And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded
   because of their testimony about Jesus
   and because of the word of God.
   They
   had not worshiped the beast
   or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands.
   They came to life and reigned
   with Christ a thousand years.

   Blessed

   has no power over them, but they will be priests
   of God and of Christ and will reign with him
   for a thousand years.

   Then I saw a great white throne
