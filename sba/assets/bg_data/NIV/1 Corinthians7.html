   Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-7-2" id="en-NIV-28490">

   But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband.

   The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife,
   and likewise the wife to her husband.

   The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife.

   Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time,
   so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan
   will not tempt you
   because of your lack of self-control.

   Now to the unmarried

   To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.

   But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband.
   And a husband must not divorce his wife.

  <span class="text 1Cor-7-12" id="en-NIV-28500">

   To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord):
   If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-7-13" id="en-NIV-28501">

   And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.

  <span class="text 1Cor-7-14" id="en-NIV-28502">

   For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.

   But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.

   If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong
