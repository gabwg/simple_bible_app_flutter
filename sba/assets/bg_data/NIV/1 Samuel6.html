   When the ark of the

   the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners
   and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   They answered, “If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift;
   by all means send a guilt offering
   to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand
   has not been lifted from you.”

   The Philistines asked, “What guilt offering should we send to him?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-6-4">
   They replied, “Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number
   of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague
   has struck both you and your rulers.

   Make models of the tumors
   and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory
   to Israel’s god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.

   Why do you harden
   your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel’s god dealt harshly with them,
   did they
   not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?

   “Now then, get a new cart
   ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked.
   Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.

   Take the ark of the

   but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh,
   then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance.”

   They placed the ark of the

   Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.

   Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat

   The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering

   The Levites
   took down the ark of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   , together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock.
   On that day the people of Beth Shemesh

   The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.

   These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the

   And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the

   But God struck down
   some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy
   of them to death because they looked
   into the ark of the
