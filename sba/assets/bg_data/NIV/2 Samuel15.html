   In the course of time,
   Absalom provided himself with a chariot
   and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him.

   He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate.
   Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, “What town are you from?” He would answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-15-3" id="en-NIV-8393">

   Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you.”

  <span class="text 2Sam-15-4" id="en-NIV-8394">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And Absalom would add, “If only I were appointed judge in the land!
   Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that they receive justice.”

   Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him.

  <span class="text 2Sam-15-6" id="en-NIV-8396">

   Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts
   of the people of Israel.

   At the end of four
   years, Absalom said to the king, “Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he went to Hebron.

  <span class="text 2Sam-15-10" id="en-NIV-8400">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets,
   then say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’”

  <span class="text 2Sam-15-11" id="en-NIV-8401">

   Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter.

   While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel
   the Gilonite, David’s counselor,
   to come from Giloh,
   his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept on increasing.

   A messenger came and told David, “The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom.”

   Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come! We must flee,
   or none of us will escape from Absalom.
   We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin on us and put the city to the sword.”

   The king said to Ittai
   the Gittite, “Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner,

   Zadok
