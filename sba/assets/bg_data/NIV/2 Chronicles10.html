   Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king.

   When Jeroboam
   son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled
   from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.

   So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel
   went to Rehoboam and said to him:

   “Your father put a heavy yoke on us,
   but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”

  <span class="text 2Chr-10-5" id="en-NIV-11401">

   Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people went away.

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Chr-10-6" id="en-NIV-11402">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders
   who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked.

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Chr-10-7" id="en-NIV-11403">

   They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer,
   they will always be your servants.”

   But Rehoboam rejected
   the advice the elders
   gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.

  <span class="text 2Chr-10-9" id="en-NIV-11405">

   He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”

   The young men who had grown up with him replied, “The people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.

  <span class="text 2Chr-10-11" id="en-NIV-11407">

   My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’”

   Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.”

  <span class="text 2Chr-10-13" id="en-NIV-11409">

   The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders,

   he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.”

   So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God,
   to fulfill the word the

   King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,
