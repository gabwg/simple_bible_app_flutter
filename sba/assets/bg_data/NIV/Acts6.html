   In those days when the number of disciples was increasing,
   the Hellenistic Jews
   among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows
   were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.

   So the Twelve gathered all the disciples
   together and said, “It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God
   in order to wait on tables.

   Brothers and sisters,
   choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit
   and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them

   This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen,
   a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit;
   also Philip,
   Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.

   They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed
   and laid their hands on them.

   So the word of God spread.
   The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly,
   and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.

   Now Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed great wonders and signs
   among the people.

   Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene
   and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia
   and Asia
   —who began to argue with Stephen.
