   When the

    Lord

   Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind,
   Elijah and Elisha

   Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here;

   has sent me to Bethel.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-2-2">
   But Elisha said, “As surely as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   So they went down to Bethel.

   The company

   is going to take your master from you today?”
  </span>

  <span class="text 2Kgs-2-4">
   And he replied, “As surely as the

   Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here;

  </span>

   And he replied, “As surely as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   So the two of them walked on.

   Fifty men from the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.

   Elijah took his cloak,
   rolled it up and struck
   the water with it. The water divided
   to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry
   ground.

   When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?”

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-2-9">
   “Let me inherit a double

   Elisha replied.

   “You have asked a difficult thing,” Elijah said, “yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours—otherwise, it will not.”

   As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire
   and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven
   in a whirlwind.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-2-12" id="en-NIV-9564">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Elisha saw this and cried out, “My father! My father! The chariots
   and horsemen of Israel!” And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his garment and tore
   it in two.

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-2-13" id="en-NIV-9565">

   Elisha then picked up Elijah’s cloak that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.

   He took the cloak
   that had fallen from Elijah and struck
   the water with it. “Where now is the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   , the God of Elijah?” he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.

   The company
   of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, “The spirit
   of Elijah is resting on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.

   “Look,” they said, “we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has picked him up
   and set him down on some mountain or in some valley.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-2-16">
   “No,” Elisha replied, “do not send them.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-2-17" id="en-NIV-9569">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But they persisted until he was too embarrassed
   to refuse. So he said, “Send them.” And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.

   The people of the city said to Elisha, “Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive.”

   Then he went out to the spring and threw
   the salt into it, saying, “This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   says: ‘I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.’”

   From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered

   He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse
