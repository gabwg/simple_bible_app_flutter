   Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire
   and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-2" id="en-NIV-28191">

   For I can testify about them that they are zealous
   for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.

  <span class="text Rom-10-3" id="en-NIV-28192">

   Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-4" id="en-NIV-28193">

   Christ is the culmination of the law
   so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
  </span>

  <span class="text Rom-10-5" id="en-NIV-28194">

   Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-6" id="en-NIV-28195">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But the righteousness that is by faith
   says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’”
   (that is, to bring Christ down)
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-7" id="en-NIV-28196">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’”
   (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-8" id="en-NIV-28197">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,”
   that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim:
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-9" id="en-NIV-28198">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   If you declare
   with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,”
   and believe
   in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
   you will be saved.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-10" id="en-NIV-28199">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-11" id="en-NIV-28200">
   <sup class="versenum">

   As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-12" id="en-NIV-28201">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile
   —the same Lord is Lord of all
   and richly blesses all who call on him,
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-13" id="en-NIV-28202">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord
   will be saved.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Rom-10-14" id="en-NIV-28203">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14

   How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-15" id="en-NIV-28204">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Rom-10-16" id="en-NIV-28205">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.
   For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-10-17" id="en-NIV-28206">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17

   Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message,
   and the message is heard through the word about Christ.

   But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did:
