   In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead,
   and in view of his appearing
   and his kingdom, I give you this charge:
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Tim-4-2" id="en-NIV-29873">
   <sup class="versenum">
    2
   </sup>
   Preach
   the word;
   be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke
   and encourage
   —with great patience and careful instruction.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Tim-4-3" id="en-NIV-29874">
   <sup class="versenum">
    3
   </sup>
   For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine.
   Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Tim-4-4" id="en-NIV-29875">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Tim-4-5" id="en-NIV-29876">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship,
   do the work of an evangelist,
   discharge all the duties of your ministry.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Tim-4-6" id="en-NIV-29877">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For I am already being poured out like a drink offering,
   and the time for my departure is near.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Tim-4-7" id="en-NIV-29878">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I have fought the good fight,
   I have finished the race,
   I have kept the faith.

  <span class="text 2Tim-4-8" id="en-NIV-29879">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Now there is in store for me
   the crown of righteousness,
   which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day
   —and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.

   But the Lord stood at my side
