   While Apollos
   was at Corinth,
   Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus.
   There he found some disciples
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-19-2" id="en-NIV-27588">

   you believed?”

  <span class="text Acts-19-2">
   They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”

   So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Acts-19-3">
   “John’s baptism,” they replied.

   Paul said, “John’s baptism
   was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”

   When Paul placed his hands on them,

   But some of them
   became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way.
   So Paul left them. He took the disciples
   with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.

   Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits
   tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of the Jesus
