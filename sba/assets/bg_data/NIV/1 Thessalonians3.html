   So when we could stand it no longer,
   we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.

   We sent Timothy,
   who is our brother and co-worker
   in God’s service in spreading the gospel of Christ,
   to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,

   so that no one would be unsettled by these trials.
   For you know quite well that we are destined for them.

   In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.

   For this reason, when I could stand it no longer,
   I sent to find out about your faith.
   I was afraid that in some way the tempter
   had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain.

   But Timothy
   has just now come to us from you
