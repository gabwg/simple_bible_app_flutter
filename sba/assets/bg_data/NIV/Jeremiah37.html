   Zedekiah
   son of Josiah was made king
   of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin
   son of Jehoiakim.

   Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention
   to the words the

   King Zedekiah, however, sent
   Jehukal
   son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah
   son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray
   to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.

   Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt,

   who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew
   from Jerusalem.

   Then the word of the

   came to Jeremiah the prophet:
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-37-7" id="en-NIV-19882">

   “This is what the

   , the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire
   of me, ‘Pharaoh’s army, which has marched
   out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt.

   Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture

   “This is what the

   Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian

   After the Babylonian army had withdrawn

  <span class="text Jer-37-12" id="en-NIV-19887">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property
   among the people there.

   But when he reached the Benjamin Gate,
   the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”

   “That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested
   Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.

   They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten
   and imprisoned
   in the house
   of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison.

   Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time.

   Then King Zedekiah sent
   for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked
   him privately,
   “Is there any word from the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   ?”
  </span>

   “Yes,” Jeremiah replied, “you will be delivered

   Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime

   But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.”

   King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread
   in the city was gone.
   So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
