   I watched as the Lamb
   opened the first of the seven seals.
   Then I heard one of the four living creatures
   say in a voice like thunder,
   “Come!”
  </span>
  <span class="text Rev-6-2" id="en-NIV-30797">

   I looked, and there before me was a white horse!
   Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown,
   and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.

  <span class="text Rev-6-3" id="en-NIV-30798">

   When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature
   say, “Come!”

   Then another horse came out, a fiery red one.
   Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth
   and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.

   When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature
   say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse!
   Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.

  <span class="text Rev-6-6" id="en-NIV-30801">

   Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures,
   saying, “Two pounds
   of wheat for a day’s wages,
   and six pounds
   of barley for a day’s wages,
   and do not damage
   the oil and the wine!”

   When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature
   say, “Come!”

   I looked, and there before me was a pale horse!
   Its rider was named Death, and Hades
   was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.

   When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under
   the altar
   the souls of those who had been slain
   because of the word of God
   and the testimony they had maintained.

  <span class="text Rev-6-10" id="en-NIV-30805">

   They called out in a loud voice, “How long,
   Sovereign Lord,
   holy and true,
   until you judge the inhabitants of the earth
   and avenge our blood?”

  <span class="text Rev-6-11" id="en-NIV-30806">

   Then each of them was given a white robe,
   and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters,
   were killed just as they had been.

   I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake.
   The sun turned black
   like sackcloth
   made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,
  </span>
  <span class="text Rev-6-13" id="en-NIV-30808">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and the stars in the sky fell to earth,
   as figs drop from a fig tree
   when shaken by a strong wind.

   The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up,
   and every mountain and island was removed from its place.

   Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free,
   hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.

   They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us
   and hide us
   from the face of him who sits on the throne
   and from the wrath of the Lamb!
