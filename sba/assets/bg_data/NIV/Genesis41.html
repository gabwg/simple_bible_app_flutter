   When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream:
   He was standing by the Nile,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-41-2" id="en-NIV-1198">
   <sup class="versenum">
    2
   </sup>
   when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat,
   and they grazed among the reeds.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-41-3" id="en-NIV-1199">
   <sup class="versenum">
    3
   </sup>
   After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-41-4" id="en-NIV-1200">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-41-5" id="en-NIV-1201">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain,
   healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-41-6" id="en-NIV-1202">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-41-7" id="en-NIV-1203">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up;
   it had been a dream.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-41-8" id="en-NIV-1204">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   In the morning his mind was troubled,
   so he sent for all the magicians
   and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-41-9" id="en-NIV-1205">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.

  <span class="text Gen-41-10" id="en-NIV-1206">

   Pharaoh was once angry with his servants,
   and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-41-11" id="en-NIV-1207">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11

   Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-41-12" id="en-NIV-1208">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   Now a young Hebrew
   was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard.
   We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-41-13" id="en-NIV-1209">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.

  <span class="text Gen-41-14" id="en-NIV-1210">

   So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon.
   When he had shaved
   and changed his clothes,
   he came before Pharaoh.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-41-15" id="en-NIV-1211">

   Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it.

  <span class="text Gen-41-16" id="en-NIV-1212">

   “I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.”

   After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.

   But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.

   Seven years of great abundance

   The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided

   They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.
