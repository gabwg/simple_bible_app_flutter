   Now Abraham moved on from there
   into the region of the Negev
   and lived between Kadesh

   But God came to Abimelek

   Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,

   Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet,

   Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.

   Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God
