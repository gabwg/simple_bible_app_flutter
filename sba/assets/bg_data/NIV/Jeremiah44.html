   This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt
   —in Migdol,
   Tahpanhes
   and Memphis
   —and in Upper Egypt:
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-44-2" id="en-NIV-20013">

   “This is what the

    Lord

   Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster
   I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah.
   Today they lie deserted and in ruins
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-44-3" id="en-NIV-20014">
   <sup class="versenum">

   because of the evil
   they have done. They aroused my anger
   by burning incense
   to and worshiping other gods
   that neither they nor you nor your ancestors
   ever knew.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-44-4" id="en-NIV-20015">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Again and again
   I sent my servants the prophets,
   who said, ‘Do not do this detestable
   thing that I hate!’
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-44-5" id="en-NIV-20016">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But they did not listen or pay attention;
   they did not turn from their wickedness

   to other gods.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-44-6" id="en-NIV-20017">

   Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out;
   it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins
   they are today.

   God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster
   on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women,

  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-44-8" id="en-NIV-20019">

   Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made,
   burning incense

   where you have come to live?
   You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse
   and an object of reproach
   among all the nations on earth.

   I will take away the remnant
   of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest,
   they will die by sword or famine.
   They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach.

   Then all the men who knew that their wives

  <span class="text Jer-44-17" id="en-NIV-20028">
   <sup class="versenum">

   We will certainly do everything we said we would:
   We will burn incense
   to the Queen of Heaven
   and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors, our kings and our officials
   did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem.
   At that time we had plenty of food
   and were well off and suffered no harm.

  <span class="text Jer-44-18" id="en-NIV-20029">

   But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings
