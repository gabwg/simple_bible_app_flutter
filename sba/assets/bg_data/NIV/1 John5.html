   Everyone who believes
   that Jesus is the Christ
   is born of God,
   and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.

   This is how we know
   that we love the children of God:
   by loving God and carrying out his commands.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1John-5-3" id="en-NIV-30628">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands.
   And his commands are not burdensome,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1John-5-4" id="en-NIV-30629">
   <sup class="versenum">

   for everyone born of God
   overcomes
   the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1John-5-5" id="en-NIV-30630">

   Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.

   This is the one who came by water and blood
   —Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1John-5-7" id="en-NIV-30632">

   For there are three

  </span>
  <span class="text 1John-5-8" id="en-NIV-30633">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   the
   Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.

  <span class="text 1John-5-9" id="en-NIV-30634">
   <sup class="versenum">

   We accept human testimony,
   but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God,
   which he has given about his Son.

  <span class="text 1John-5-10" id="en-NIV-30635">

   Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony.
   Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar,
   because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.

  <span class="text 1John-5-11" id="en-NIV-30636">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life,
   and this life is in his Son.

   This is the confidence
   we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.

   If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life.
   I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death.
   I am not saying that you should pray about that.

   We know also that the Son of God has come
