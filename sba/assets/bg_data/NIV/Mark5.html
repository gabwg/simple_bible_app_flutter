   When Jesus got out of the boat,
   a man with an impure spirit
   came from the tombs to meet him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-3" id="en-NIV-24368">

   This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.

   For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.

  <span class="text Mark-5-5" id="en-NIV-24370">

   Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.

  <span class="text Mark-5-6" id="en-NIV-24371">

   When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-7" id="en-NIV-24372">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me,
   Jesus, Son of the Most High God?
   In God’s name don’t torture me!”
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-8" id="en-NIV-24373">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For Jesus had said to him,
   <span class="woj">
    “Come out of this man, you impure spirit!”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-5-9" id="en-NIV-24374">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9

   Then Jesus asked him,
   <span class="woj">
    “What is your name?”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-5-9">
   “My name is Legion,”
   he replied, “for we are many.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-10" id="en-NIV-24375">

   And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.

   A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-12" id="en-NIV-24377">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-13" id="en-NIV-24378">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.

 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-5-14" id="en-NIV-24379">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.

  <span class="text Mark-5-15" id="en-NIV-24380">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion
   of demons,
   sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-16" id="en-NIV-24381">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-17" id="en-NIV-24382">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.

 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-5-18" id="en-NIV-24383">
   <sup class="versenum">

   As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.

  <span class="text Mark-5-19" id="en-NIV-24384">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Jesus did not let him, but said,
   <span class="woj">
    “Go home to your own people and tell them
    how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”

  <span class="text Mark-5-20" id="en-NIV-24385">

   So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis
   how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.

   When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake,
   a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.

  <span class="text Mark-5-22" id="en-NIV-24387">

   Then one of the synagogue leaders,

  <span class="text Mark-5-23" id="en-NIV-24388">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on

  <span class="text Mark-5-24" id="en-NIV-24389">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Jesus went with him.

 <p>

   A large crowd followed and pressed around him.

   And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding

   She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.

  <span class="text Mark-5-27" id="en-NIV-24392">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-28" id="en-NIV-24393">
   <sup class="versenum">

   because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes,

  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-5-29" id="en-NIV-24394">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-5-30" id="en-NIV-24395">
   <sup class="versenum">

   At once Jesus realized that power
   had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked,

    “Who touched my clothes?”

   “You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask,

   Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.

  <span class="text Mark-5-34" id="en-NIV-24399">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He said to her,

   Overhearing

  <span class="text Mark-5-39" id="en-NIV-24404">
   <sup class="versenum">
    39

   He went in and said to them,

   He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this,
