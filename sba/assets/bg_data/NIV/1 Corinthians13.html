   If I speak in the tongues
   of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.

   If I have the gift of prophecy
   and can fathom all mysteries
   and all knowledge,
   and if I have a faith

   Love is patient,
   love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.

   Love never fails. But where there are prophecies,
   they will cease; where there are tongues,
   they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
