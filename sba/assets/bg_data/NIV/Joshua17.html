   This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh
   as Joseph’s firstborn,
   that is, for Makir,
   Manasseh’s firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead
   and Bashan
   because the Makirites were great soldiers.

   So this allotment was for the rest of the people of Manasseh

   Shechem, Hepher
   and Shemida.
   These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.
