   God’s Marvelous Plan for the Gentiles

   For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner
   of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Eph-3-2" id="en-NIV-29254">

   Surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given to me
   for you,
  </span>
  <span class="text Eph-3-3" id="en-NIV-29255">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   that is, the mystery
   made known to me by revelation,
   as I have already written briefly.
  </span>
  <span class="text Eph-3-4" id="en-NIV-29256">

   In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight
   into the mystery of Christ,
  </span>
  <span class="text Eph-3-5" id="en-NIV-29257">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.
  </span>
  <span class="text Eph-3-6" id="en-NIV-29258">
   <sup class="versenum">

   This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs
   together with Israel, members together of one body,
   and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.

 <p>
  <span class="text Eph-3-7" id="en-NIV-29259">

   I became a servant of this gospel
   by the gift of God’s grace given me
   through the working of his power.

  <span class="text Eph-3-8" id="en-NIV-29260">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people,
   this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles
   the boundless riches of Christ,
  </span>
  <span class="text Eph-3-9" id="en-NIV-29261">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery,
   which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.
  </span>
  <span class="text Eph-3-10" id="en-NIV-29262">
   <sup class="versenum">

   His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God
   should be made known
   to the rulers and authorities
   in the heavenly realms,
  </span>
  <span class="text Eph-3-11" id="en-NIV-29263">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11

   according to his eternal purpose
   that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   In him and through faith in him we may approach God
   with freedom and confidence.

  <span class="text Eph-3-17" id="en-NIV-29269">
