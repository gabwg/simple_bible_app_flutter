   For I do not want you to be ignorant
   of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud
   and that they all passed through the sea.

   No temptation
   has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful;
   he will not let you be tempted

   But when you are tempted,
   he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.
