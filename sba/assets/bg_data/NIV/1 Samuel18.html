   After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan
   became one in spirit with David, and he loved
   him as himself.

   From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-18-3" id="en-NIV-7680">

   And Jonathan made a covenant
   with David because he loved him as himself.

   Jonathan took off the robe
   he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.

   Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful
   that Saul gave him a high rank in the army.
   This pleased all the troops, and Saul’s officers as well.

   When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing,
   with joyful songs and with timbrels
   and lyres.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-18-7" id="en-NIV-7684">

   As they danced, they sang:

   Saul was very angry; this refrain displeased him greatly. “They have credited David with tens of thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?
   ”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-18-9" id="en-NIV-7686">

   And from that time on Saul kept a close

   The next day an evil
   spirit
   from God came forcefully on Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the lyre,
   as he usually
   did. Saul had a spear
   in his hand
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-18-11" id="en-NIV-7688">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and he hurled it, saying to himself,
   “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded
   him twice.

  <span class="text 1Sam-18-12" id="en-NIV-7689">

   Saul was afraid
   of David, because the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   was with
   David but had departed from
   Saul.

   So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led
   the troops in their campaigns.

  <span class="text 1Sam-18-14" id="en-NIV-7691">

   In everything he did he had great success,
   because the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

  <span class="text 1Sam-18-15" id="en-NIV-7692">

   When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him.

  <span class="text 1Sam-18-16" id="en-NIV-7693">

   But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.

   Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter
   Merab. I will give her to you in marriage;
   only serve me bravely and fight the battles
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   .” For Saul said to himself,
   “I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-18-18" id="en-NIV-7695">

   But David said to Saul, “Who am I,
   and what is my family or my clan in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?

  <span class="text 1Sam-18-19" id="en-NIV-7696">

   So
   when the time came for Merab,
   Saul’s daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.

   Now Saul’s daughter Michal
   was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.

   “I will give her to him,” he thought, “so that she may be a snare
   to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-18-22" id="en-NIV-7699">

   Then Saul ordered his attendants: “Speak to David privately and say, ‘Look, the king likes you, and his attendants all love you; now become his son-in-law.’”

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-18-23" id="en-NIV-7700">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They repeated these words to David. But David said, “Do you think it is a small matter to become the king’s son-in-law?
   I’m only a poor man and little known.”

  <span class="text 1Sam-18-24" id="en-NIV-7701">

  <span class="text 1Sam-18-25" id="en-NIV-7702">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king wants no other price
   for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge
   on his enemies.’” Saul’s plan
   was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-18-26" id="en-NIV-7703">

   When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,

  <span class="text 1Sam-18-27" id="en-NIV-7704">
   <sup class="versenum">
    27

   David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal
   in marriage.

   When Saul realized that the

   Saul became still more afraid

   The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success
   than the rest of Saul’s officers, and his name became well known.
