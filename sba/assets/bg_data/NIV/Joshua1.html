   After the death of Moses the servant of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ,
   the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   said to Joshua
   son of Nun, Moses’ aide:
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-2" id="en-NIV-5854">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River
   into the land
   I am about to give to them
   —to the Israelites.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-3" id="en-NIV-5855">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   I will give you every place where you set your foot,
   as I promised Moses.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-4" id="en-NIV-5856">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon,
   and from the great river, the Euphrates
   —all the Hittite
   country—to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-5" id="en-NIV-5857">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   No one will be able to stand against you
   all the days of your life. As I was with
   Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake
   you.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-6" id="en-NIV-5858">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   Be strong
   and courageous,
   because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors
   to give them.

  <span class="text Josh-1-7" id="en-NIV-5859">

   “Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey
   all the law
   my servant Moses
   gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left,
   that you may be successful wherever you go.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-8" id="en-NIV-5860">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   Keep this Book of the Law
   always on your lips;
   meditate
   on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.

  <span class="text Josh-1-9" id="en-NIV-5861">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid;
   do not be discouraged,
   for the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God will be with you wherever you go.”

   So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-11" id="en-NIV-5863">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   “Go through the camp
   and tell the people, ‘Get your provisions
   ready. Three days
   from now you will cross the Jordan
   here to go in and take possession
   of the land the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God is giving you for your own.’”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-1-12" id="en-NIV-5864">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
   Joshua said,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-13" id="en-NIV-5865">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   “Remember the command that Moses the servant of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   gave you after he said, ‘The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   your God will give you rest
   by giving you this land.’
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-14" id="en-NIV-5866">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   Your wives,
   your children and your livestock may stay in the land
   that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle,
   must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites.
   You are to help them
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-15" id="en-NIV-5867">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   until the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-1-16" id="en-NIV-5868">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   Then they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-17" id="en-NIV-5869">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you.
   Only may the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God be with you as he was with Moses.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-1-18" id="en-NIV-5870">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey
   it, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!
