   But God remembered
   Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth,
   and the waters receded.

   Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens
   had been closed, and the rain
   had stopped falling from the sky.

   The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days
   the water had gone down,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-8-4" id="en-NIV-188">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month
   the ark came to rest on the mountains
   of Ararat.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-8-5" id="en-NIV-189">

   The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.

   After forty days
   Noah opened a window he had made in the ark
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-8-7" id="en-NIV-191">

   and sent out a raven,
   and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.

   Then he sent out a dove
   to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.

   But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.

   He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.

   When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.

   He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.

   By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year,
   the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.

   Then God said to Noah,

   “Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.

   Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.”

   All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on land—came out of the ark, one kind after another.

   Then Noah built an altar to the

   smelled the pleasing aroma

   all living creatures,
