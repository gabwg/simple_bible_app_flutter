   In the land of Uz
   there lived a man whose name was Job.
   This man was blameless
   and upright;
   he feared God
   and shunned evil.
  </span>
  <span class="text Job-1-2" id="en-NIV-12872">

   He had seven sons

  <span class="text Job-1-3" id="en-NIV-12873">

   and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys,
   and had a large number of servants.
   He was the greatest man
   among all the people of the East.

   His sons used to hold feasts
   in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.

   When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified.
   Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering
   for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned
   and cursed God
   in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom.
