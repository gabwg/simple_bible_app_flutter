   A great sign
   appeared in heaven:
   a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars
   on her head.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rev-12-2" id="en-NIV-30895">

   She was pregnant and cried out in pain
   as she was about to give birth.

  <span class="text Rev-12-3" id="en-NIV-30896">

   Then another sign appeared in heaven:
   an enormous red dragon
   with seven heads
   and ten horns
   and seven crowns
   on its heads.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rev-12-4" id="en-NIV-30897">

   Its tail swept a third
   of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth.
   The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child
   the moment he was born.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rev-12-5" id="en-NIV-30898">

   She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.”
   And her child was snatched up
   to God and to his throne.

  <span class="text Rev-12-6" id="en-NIV-30899">

   The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.

   Then war broke out in heaven. Michael
   and his angels fought against the dragon,
   and the dragon and his angels
   fought back.

   The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent
   called the devil,
   or Satan,
   who leads the whole world astray.
   He was hurled to the earth,
   and his angels with him.

   The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle,
