   But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus
   basket
   for him and coated it with tar and pitch.
   Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds

   Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank.

   One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people
   were and watched them at their hard labor.
   He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.

   Now a priest of Midian

   During that long period,

   The Israelites groaned in their slavery
