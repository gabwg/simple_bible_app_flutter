   Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-2" id="en-NIV-12385">

   Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-5-3" id="en-NIV-12386">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields,
   our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-5-4" id="en-NIV-12387">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Still others were saying, “We have had to borrow money to pay the king’s tax
   on our fields and vineyards.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-5" id="en-NIV-12388">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Although we are of the same flesh and blood
   as our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery.
   Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-5-6" id="en-NIV-12389">

   When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-7" id="en-NIV-12390">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, “You are charging your own people interest!”
   So I called together a large meeting to deal with them
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-8" id="en-NIV-12391">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   and said: “As far as possible, we have bought
   back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!” They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-5-9" id="en-NIV-12392">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9

   So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach
   of our Gentile enemies?
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-10" id="en-NIV-12393">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let us stop charging interest!
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-11" id="en-NIV-12394">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the interest
   you are charging them—one percent of the money, grain, new wine and olive oil.”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-5-12" id="en-NIV-12395">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “We will give it back,” they said. “And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-5-12">
   Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath
   to do what they had promised.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-13" id="en-NIV-12396">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I also shook
   out the folds of my robe and said, “In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-5-13">
   At this the whole assembly said, “Amen,”
   and praised the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   . And the people did as they had promised.
  </span>

   Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes,
   when I was appointed to be their governor
   in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year—twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-15" id="en-NIV-12398">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels
   of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God
   I did not act like that.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-5-16" id="en-NIV-12399">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Instead,
   I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we
   did not acquire any land.

 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-5-17" id="en-NIV-12400">

   Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.

  <span class="text Neh-5-18" id="en-NIV-12401">

   Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry
   were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.

   Remember
   me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people.
