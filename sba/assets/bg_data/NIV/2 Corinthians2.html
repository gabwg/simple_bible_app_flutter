   So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.

   I wrote as I did,
   so that when I came I would not be distressed
   by those who should have made me rejoice. I had confidence

   If anyone has caused grief,
   he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent—not to put it too severely.

   Now when I went to Troas
