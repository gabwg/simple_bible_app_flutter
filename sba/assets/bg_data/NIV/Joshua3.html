   Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim
   and went to the Jordan,
   where they camped before crossing over.

   After three days
   the officers
   went throughout the camp,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-3-3" id="en-NIV-5897">
   <sup class="versenum">

   giving orders to the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God, and the Levitical
   priests

  <span class="text Josh-3-4" id="en-NIV-5898">

   Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits
   between you and the ark; do not go near it.”

   Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves,
   for tomorrow the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.” So they took it up and went ahead of them.

   And the

   said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you

   Tell the priests

   Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the

   This is how you will know that the living God
   is among you
   and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites,
   Hivites, Perizzites,
   Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.

   Now then, choose twelve men

   So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant
   went ahead
   of them.

   Now the Jordan
   is at flood stage
   all during harvest.
   Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge,

   the water from upstream stopped flowing.
   It piled up in a heap
   a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan,
   while the water flowing down
   to the Sea of the Arabah
   (that is, the Dead Sea
   ) was completely cut off.
   So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
