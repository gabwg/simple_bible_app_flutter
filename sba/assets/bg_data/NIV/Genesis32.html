   Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God
   met him.

   When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!”
   So he named that place Mahanaim.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-3" id="en-NIV-932">

   Jacob sent messengers
   ahead of him to his brother Esau
   in the land of Seir,
   the country of Edom.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-4" id="en-NIV-933">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord
   Esau: ‘Your servant
   Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban
   and have remained there till now.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-5" id="en-NIV-934">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants.
   Now I am sending this message to my lord,
   that I may find favor in your eyes.
   ’”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-6" id="en-NIV-935">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-7" id="en-NIV-936">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   In great fear
   and distress
   Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups,
   and the flocks and herds and camels as well.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-8" id="en-NIV-937">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group,
   the group
   that is left may escape.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-9" id="en-NIV-938">

   Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham,
   God of my father Isaac,
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-10" id="en-NIV-939">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness
   you have shown your servant. I had only my staff
   when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-11" id="en-NIV-940">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid
   he will come and attack me,
   and also the mothers with their children.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-12" id="en-NIV-941">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12

   But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand
   of the sea, which cannot be counted.

  <span class="text Gen-32-13" id="en-NIV-942">

   He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift
   for his brother Esau:
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-14" id="en-NIV-943">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-15" id="en-NIV-944">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-16" id="en-NIV-945">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-17" id="en-NIV-946">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-18" id="en-NIV-947">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18
   </sup>
   then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant
   Jacob. They are a gift
   sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-19" id="en-NIV-948">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19
   </sup>
   He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-20" id="en-NIV-949">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   And be sure to say, ‘Your servant
   Jacob is coming behind us.’” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts
   I am sending on ahead;
   later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-21" id="en-NIV-950">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21

   So Jacob’s gifts
   went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.

   That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons
   and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-23" id="en-NIV-952">
   <sup class="versenum">

   After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-24" id="en-NIV-953">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Jacob was left alone,
   and a man
   wrestled with him till daybreak.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-25" id="en-NIV-954">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25

   When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip
   so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-26" id="en-NIV-955">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26
   </sup>
   Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-26">
   But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-27" id="en-NIV-956">
   <sup class="versenum">
    27
   </sup>
   The man asked him, “What is your name?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-27">
   “Jacob,”
   he answered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-28" id="en-NIV-957">
   <sup class="versenum">
    28
   </sup>
   Then the man said, “Your name
   will no longer be Jacob, but Israel,
   because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-29" id="en-NIV-958">
   <sup class="versenum">
    29
   </sup>
   Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-29">
   But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?”
   Then he blessed
   him there.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-30" id="en-NIV-959">
   <sup class="versenum">
    30
   </sup>
   So Jacob called the place Peniel,
   saying, “It is because I saw God face to face,
   and yet my life was spared.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-32-31" id="en-NIV-960">
   <sup class="versenum">
    31
   </sup>
   The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,
   and he was limping because of his hip.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-32-32" id="en-NIV-961">
   <sup class="versenum">
    32
   </sup>
   Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip,
   because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.
