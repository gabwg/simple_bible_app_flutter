   In the third year of Cyrus
   king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar).
   Its message was true
   and it concerned a great war.
   The understanding of the message came to him in a vision.

   At that time I, Daniel, mourned
   for three weeks.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-10-3" id="en-NIV-22019">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips;
   and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.

   On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank
   of the great river, the Tigris,
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-10-5" id="en-NIV-22021">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I looked up
   and there before me was a man dressed in linen,
   with a belt of fine gold
   from Uphaz around his waist.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-10-6" id="en-NIV-22022">

   His body was like topaz,
   his face like lightning,
   his eyes like flaming torches,
   his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze,
   and his voice
   like the sound of a multitude.

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-10-7" id="en-NIV-22023">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; those who were with me did not see it,
   but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-10-8" id="en-NIV-22024">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So I was left alone,
   gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left,
   my face turned deathly pale
   and I was helpless.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-10-9" id="en-NIV-22025">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-10-10" id="en-NIV-22026">
   <sup class="versenum">

   A hand touched me
   and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-10-11" id="en-NIV-22027">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11

   He said, “Daniel, you who are highly esteemed,
   consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up,
   for I have now been sent to you.” And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-10-12" id="en-NIV-22028">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   Then he continued, “Do not be afraid,
   Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble
   yourself before your God, your words
   were heard, and I have come in response to them.

  <span class="text Dan-10-13" id="en-NIV-22029">

   But the prince
   of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael,
   one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.

  <span class="text Dan-10-14" id="en-NIV-22030">

   Now I have come to explain
   to you what will happen to your people in the future,
   for the vision concerns a time yet to come.
   ”

  <span class="text Dan-10-15" id="en-NIV-22031">
   <sup class="versenum">

   While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-10-16" id="en-NIV-22032">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   Then one who looked like a man
   touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak.
   I said to the one standing before me, “I am overcome with anguish
   because of the vision, my lord, and I feel very weak.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-10-17" id="en-NIV-22033">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17

   How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-10-18" id="en-NIV-22034">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   Again the one who looked like a man touched
   me and gave me strength.

   <sup class="versenum">

   “Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed,”
   he said. “Peace!
   Be strong now; be strong.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-10-19">
   When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-10-20" id="en-NIV-22036">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   So he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece
   will come;

  <span class="text Dan-10-21" id="en-NIV-22037">

   but first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth.
   (No one supports me against them except Michael,
   your prince.
