   In the four hundred and eightieth
   year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month,
   he began to build the temple of the

   The temple
   that King Solomon built for the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high.

   The portico
   at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits,
   and projected ten cubits
   from the front of the temple.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-6-4" id="en-NIV-8901">

   He made narrow windows

   Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms.

   The lowest floor was five cubits
   wide, the middle floor six cubits
   and the third floor seven.
   He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.

   In building the temple, only blocks dressed
   at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool
   was heard at the temple site while it was being built.

   The entrance to the lowest

   “As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, observe my laws and keep all my commands
