   When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica,
   where there was a Jewish synagogue.

   As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue,
   and on three Sabbath
   days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-17-3" id="en-NIV-27527">

   explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer
   and rise from the dead.
   “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,”
   he said.

  <span class="text Acts-17-4" id="en-NIV-27528">

   Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas,
   as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.

  <span class="text Acts-17-5" id="en-NIV-27529">

   But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city.
   They rushed to Jason’s
   house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.

  <span class="text Acts-17-6" id="en-NIV-27530">

   But when they did not find them, they dragged
   Jason and some other believers
   before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world
   have now come here,
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-17-7" id="en-NIV-27531">

   and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-17-8" id="en-NIV-27532">

   As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas
   away to Berea.
   On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.

  <span class="text Acts-17-11" id="en-NIV-27535">

   Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica,
   for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures
   every day to see if what Paul said was true.

  <span class="text Acts-17-12" id="en-NIV-27536">

   As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.

   But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea,
   some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.

   The believers

   Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens

   While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-17-17" id="en-NIV-27541">

   So he reasoned in the synagogue
   with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.

   A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news
   about Jesus and the resurrection.

   Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus,
   where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching
   is that you are presenting?

   Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus
