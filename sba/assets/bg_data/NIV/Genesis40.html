   Some time later, the cupbearer
   and the baker
   of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.

   Pharaoh was angry
   with his two officials,
   the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-3" id="en-NIV-1176">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,
   in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-4" id="en-NIV-1177">

   The captain of the guard
   assigned them to Joseph,
   and he attended them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-4">
   After they had been in custody
   for some time,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-5" id="en-NIV-1178">
   <sup class="versenum">

   each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream
   the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-6" id="en-NIV-1179">

   When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-7" id="en-NIV-1180">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody
   with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-8" id="en-NIV-1181">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-8">
   Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God?
   Tell me your dreams.”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-9" id="en-NIV-1182">

   So the chief cupbearer
   told Joseph his dream. He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-10" id="en-NIV-1183">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed,
   and its clusters ripened into grapes.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-11" id="en-NIV-1184">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-12" id="en-NIV-1185">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   “This is what it means,
   ” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-13" id="en-NIV-1186">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   Within three days
   Pharaoh will lift up your head
   and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-14" id="en-NIV-1187">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   But when all goes well with you, remember me
   and show me kindness;
   mention me to Pharaoh
   and get me out of this prison.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-15" id="en-NIV-1188">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews,
   and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-16" id="en-NIV-1189">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   When the chief baker
   saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation,
   he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets
   of bread.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-17" id="en-NIV-1190">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-18" id="en-NIV-1191">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18
   </sup>
   “This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-19" id="en-NIV-1192">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Within three days
   Pharaoh will lift off your head
   and impale your body on a pole.
   And the birds will eat away your flesh.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-20" id="en-NIV-1193">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   Now the third day
   was Pharaoh’s birthday,
   and he gave a feast for all his officials.
   He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker
   in the presence of his officials:
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-21" id="en-NIV-1194">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21
   </sup>
   He restored the chief cupbearer
   to his position,
   so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand
   —
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-40-22" id="en-NIV-1195">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22
   </sup>
   but he impaled the chief baker,
   just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-40-23" id="en-NIV-1196">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
