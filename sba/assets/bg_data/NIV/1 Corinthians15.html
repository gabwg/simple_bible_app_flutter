   Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel

   For what I received
   I passed on to you

  <span class="text 1Cor-15-6" id="en-NIV-28725">

   After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.
