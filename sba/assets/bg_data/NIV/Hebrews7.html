   Melchizedek the Priest

   This Melchizedek was king of Salem
   and priest of God Most High.
   He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-2" id="en-NIV-30067">
   <sup class="versenum">
    2
   </sup>
   and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means “king of righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-3" id="en-NIV-30068">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Without father or mother, without genealogy,
   without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God,
   he remains a priest forever.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Heb-7-4" id="en-NIV-30069">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch
   Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-5" id="en-NIV-30070">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people
   —that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-6" id="en-NIV-30071">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed
   him who had the promises.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-7" id="en-NIV-30072">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-8" id="en-NIV-30073">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-9" id="en-NIV-30074">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-10" id="en-NIV-30075">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="text Heb-7-11" id="en-NIV-30076">

 <p>
  <span class="text Heb-7-11">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people
   established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come,
   one in the order of Melchizedek,
   not in the order of Aaron?
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-12" id="en-NIV-30077">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-13" id="en-NIV-30078">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe,
   and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-14" id="en-NIV-30079">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14

   For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah,
   and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.

  <span class="text Heb-7-15" id="en-NIV-30080">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-16" id="en-NIV-30081">
   <sup class="versenum">

   one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.

  <span class="text Heb-7-17" id="en-NIV-30082">

 <div class="poetry top-05">

  <span class="text Heb-7-18" id="en-NIV-30083">

   The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-19" id="en-NIV-30084">
   <sup class="versenum">

   (for the law made nothing perfect),
   and a better hope
   is introduced, by which we draw near to God.

   And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-21" id="en-NIV-30086">
   <sup class="versenum">

   but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him:

 </p>
 <div class="poetry top-05">
  <p class="line">

    “The Lord has sworn

   Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.

   Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-24" id="en-NIV-30089">
   <sup class="versenum">

  <span class="text Heb-7-25" id="en-NIV-30090">

   Therefore he is able to save
   completely
   those who come to God
   through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.

 <p>
  <span class="text Heb-7-26" id="en-NIV-30091">

   Such a high priest
   truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners,
   exalted above the heavens.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-27" id="en-NIV-30092">
   <sup class="versenum">
    27

   Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices
   day after day, first for his own sins,
   and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all
   when he offered himself.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-7-28" id="en-NIV-30093">
   <sup class="versenum">
    28

   For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness;
   but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son,
   who has been made perfect
   forever.
