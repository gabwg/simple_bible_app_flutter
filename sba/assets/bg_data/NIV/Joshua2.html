   Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies
   from Shittim.
   “Go, look over
   the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.
   ” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab
   and stayed there.

   The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.”

   So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab:
   “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.”

   But the woman had taken the two men
   and hidden them.
   She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.

   At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate,
   they left. I don’t know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.”

  <span class="text Josh-2-7" id="en-NIV-5877">

   So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan,
   and as soon as the pursuers

   and said to them, “I know that the

   of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.

   We have heard how the

   dried up
   the water of the Red Sea

   east of the Jordan,
   whom you completely destroyed.

   When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear

   because of you,

   “Now then, please swear to me

   “Our lives for your lives!”
   the men assured her. “If you don’t tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully

   Now the men had said to her, “This oath

   unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord

   If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads;
   we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house with you, their blood will be on our head

   Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.
