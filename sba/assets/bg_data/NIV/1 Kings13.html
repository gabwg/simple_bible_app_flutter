   By the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   a man of God
   came from Judah to Bethel,
   as Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering.

  <span class="text 1Kgs-13-2" id="en-NIV-9187">

   By the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   he cried out against the altar: “Altar, altar! This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   says: ‘A son named Josiah
   will be born to the house of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places
   who make offerings here, and human bones will be burned on you.’”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-13-3" id="en-NIV-9188">

   That same day the man of God gave a sign:
   “This is the sign the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has declared: The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-13-4" id="en-NIV-9189">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-13-5" id="en-NIV-9190">

   Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   .

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-13-6" id="en-NIV-9191">

   Then the king said to the man of God, “Intercede
   with the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored.” So the man of God interceded with the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , and the king’s hand was restored and became as it was before.

   The king said to the man of God, “Come home with me for a meal, and I will give you a gift.”

   But the man of God answered the king, “Even if you were to give me half your possessions,
   I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread
   or drink water here.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-13-9" id="en-NIV-9194">

   So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.

   Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king.

   Their father asked them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken.

   The old prophet answered, “I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the
