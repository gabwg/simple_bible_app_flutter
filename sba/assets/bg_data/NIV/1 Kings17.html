   Now Elijah
   the Tishbite, from Tishbe
   in Gilead,
   said to Ahab, “As the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   , the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain
   in the next few years except at my word.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-2">

   Then the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   came to Elijah:
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-3" id="en-NIV-9321">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “Leave here, turn eastward and hide
   in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-4" id="en-NIV-9322">
   <sup class="versenum">

   You will drink from the brook, and I have directed the ravens
   to supply you with food there.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-5" id="en-NIV-9323">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   So he did what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-6" id="en-NIV-9324">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning
   and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.

   Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-8" id="en-NIV-9326">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   Then the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   came to him:
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-9" id="en-NIV-9327">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   “Go at once to Zarephath
   in the region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow
   there to supply you with food.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-10" id="en-NIV-9328">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, “Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-11" id="en-NIV-9329">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   As she was going to get it, he called, “And bring me, please, a piece of bread.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-12" id="en-NIV-9330">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “As surely as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God lives,” she replied, “I don’t have any bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil
   in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it—and die.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-13" id="en-NIV-9331">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-14" id="en-NIV-9332">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   For this is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   sends rain
   on the land.’”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-15" id="en-NIV-9333">
   <sup class="versenum">

   She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-16" id="en-NIV-9334">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16

   For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   spoken by Elijah.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-17" id="en-NIV-9335">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-18" id="en-NIV-9336">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin
   and kill my son?”
  </span>

  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-19" id="en-NIV-9337">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “Give me your son,” Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-20" id="en-NIV-9338">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then he cried
   out to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , “
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   my God, have you brought tragedy even on this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-21" id="en-NIV-9339">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21

   Then he stretched
   himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , “
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   The

   heard Elijah’s cry, and the boy’s life returned to him, and he lived.

  <span class="text 1Kgs-17-23" id="en-NIV-9341">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother
   and said, “Look, your son is alive!”

   Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know

   from your mouth is the truth.”
