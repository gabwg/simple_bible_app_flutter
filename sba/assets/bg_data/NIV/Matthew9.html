   Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man

   Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.

   Some men brought to him a paralyzed man,
   lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith,
   he said to the man,
   <span class="woj">
    “Take heart,
    son; your sins are forgiven.”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Matt-9-3" id="en-NIV-23383">

   At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!”

 <p>
  <span class="text Matt-9-4" id="en-NIV-23384">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Knowing their thoughts,
   Jesus said,
   <span class="woj">
    “Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?

  </span>
  <span class="text Matt-9-5" id="en-NIV-23385">
   <span class="woj">
    <sup class="versenum">

    Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?

  <span class="text Matt-9-6" id="en-NIV-23386">
   <span class="woj">

    But I want you to know that the Son of Man
    has authority on earth to forgive sins.”
   </span>
   So he said to the paralyzed man,
   <span class="woj">
    “Get up, take your mat and go home.”

  </span>
  <span class="text Matt-9-7" id="en-NIV-23387">

  <span class="text Matt-9-8" id="en-NIV-23388">

   As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth.

   While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.

  <span class="text Matt-9-12" id="en-NIV-23392">
   <sup class="versenum">

 <p>
  <span class="text Matt-9-15" id="en-NIV-23395">
