   Therefore let us move beyond
   the elementary teachings
   about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death,
   and of faith in God,

   It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened,

   and who have fallen

   To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God

   When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-6-14" id="en-NIV-30059">
   <sup class="versenum">

   saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-6-15" id="en-NIV-30060">

   And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.

 <p>
  <span class="text Heb-6-16" id="en-NIV-30061">

   People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-6-17" id="en-NIV-30062">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Because God wanted to make the unchanging
   nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised,
   he confirmed it with an oath.
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-6-18" id="en-NIV-30063">

   God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie,
   we who have fled to take hold of the hope
   set before us may be greatly encouraged.
