   I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure
   to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless.

   I tried cheering myself with wine,
   and embracing folly
   —my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.

   I amassed silver and gold
   for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces.
   I acquired male and female singers,
