   Therefore, there is now no condemnation

  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-8-2" id="en-NIV-28119">

   because through Christ Jesus
   the law of the Spirit who gives life

   For what the law was powerless
   to do because it was weakened by the flesh,
   God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh
   to be a sin offering.
   And so he condemned sin in the flesh,
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-8-4" id="en-NIV-28121">
   <sup class="versenum">

   in order that the righteous requirement

   Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires;

  <span class="text Rom-8-6" id="en-NIV-28123">

   The mind governed by the flesh is death,

  <span class="text Rom-8-7" id="en-NIV-28124">

   The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God;

   You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh
   but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.
   And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ,
   they do not belong to Christ.

   And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead

   The Spirit
