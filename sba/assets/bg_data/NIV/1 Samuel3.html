   The boy Samuel ministered
   before the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   under Eli. In those days the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   was rare;
   there were not many visions.

   One night Eli, whose eyes
   were becoming so weak that he could barely see,
   was lying down in his usual place.

   The lamp
   of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , where the ark
   of God was.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-4" id="en-NIV-7281">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   called Samuel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-4">
   Samuel answered, “Here I am.

  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-5" id="en-NIV-7282">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-5">
   But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-6" id="en-NIV-7283">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Again the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-6">
   “My son,” Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-7" id="en-NIV-7284">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Now Samuel did not yet know
   the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   : The word
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had not yet been revealed
   to him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-8" id="en-NIV-7285">
   <sup class="versenum">

   A third time the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-8">
   Then Eli realized that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   was calling the boy.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-9" id="en-NIV-7286">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9

   So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, ‘Speak,
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , for your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-10" id="en-NIV-7287">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10

   The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   came and stood there, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!
   ”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-10">
   Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-11" id="en-NIV-7288">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   And the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Samuel: “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-12" id="en-NIV-7289">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   At that time I will carry out against Eli everything
   I spoke against his family—from beginning to end.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-13" id="en-NIV-7290">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God,
   and he failed to restrain
   them.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-14" id="en-NIV-7291">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, ‘The guilt of Eli’s house will never be atoned
   for by sacrifice or offering.’”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-15" id="en-NIV-7292">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15

   Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   . He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-16" id="en-NIV-7293">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-16">
   Samuel answered, “Here I am.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-17" id="en-NIV-7294">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17

   “What was it he said to you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide
   it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely,
   if you hide from me anything he told you.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-3-18" id="en-NIV-7295">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, “He is the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ; let him do what is good in his eyes.”

   The

   was with
   Samuel as he grew

  <span class="text 1Sam-3-20" id="en-NIV-7297">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba
   recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the
