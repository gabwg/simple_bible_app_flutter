   Five days later the high priest Ananias
   went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges
   against Paul before the governor.

   When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.

   Everywhere and in every way, most excellent

   “We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots
   among the Jews
   all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene

   When the governor

   You can easily verify that no more than twelve days

   My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple,

   However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors
   as a follower of the Way,
   which they call a sect.
   I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,

  <span class="text Acts-24-15" id="en-NIV-27785">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I was ceremonially clean

   As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control

   and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.”
