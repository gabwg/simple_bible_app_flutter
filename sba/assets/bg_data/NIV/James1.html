   Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,
   whenever you face trials of many kinds,
  </span>
  <span class="text Jas-1-3" id="en-NIV-30270">
   <sup class="versenum">

   because you know that the testing of your faith
   produces perseverance.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jas-1-4" id="en-NIV-30271">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature
   and complete, not lacking anything.

  <span class="text Jas-1-5" id="en-NIV-30272">

   If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God,
   who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.

  <span class="text Jas-1-6" id="en-NIV-30273">

   But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt,
   because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.

   That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.

   Such a person is double-minded

   For the sun rises with scorching heat

   Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial

   When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;
  </span>
  <span class="text Jas-1-14" id="en-NIV-30281">

   and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.

   Every good and perfect gift is from above,

   My dear brothers and sisters,
   take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak
   and slow to become angry,
  </span>
  <span class="text Jas-1-20" id="en-NIV-30287">
   <sup class="versenum">

   because human anger
   does not produce the righteousness that God desires.

  <span class="text Jas-1-21" id="en-NIV-30288">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Therefore, get rid of
   all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you,
   which can save you.

   Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jas-1-23" id="en-NIV-30290">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror

   But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom,
   and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.

   Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues
   deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.

   Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after
   orphans and widows
   in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
