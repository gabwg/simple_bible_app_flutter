   When Athaliah
   the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family.

   But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram
   and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash
   son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes, who were about to be murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah; so he was not killed.

   In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the Carites

   He commanded them, saying, “This is what you are to do: You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath

   The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty—and came to Jehoiada the priest.

   Jehoiada brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him; he presented him with a copy of the covenant

   She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar,

   Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops: “Bring her out between the ranks
