   Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
   and our being gathered to him,
   we ask you, brothers and sisters,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-2" id="en-NIV-29664">
   <sup class="versenum">

   not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter
   —asserting that the day of the Lord
   has already come.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-3" id="en-NIV-29665">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Don’t let anyone deceive you
   in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion
   occurs and the man of lawlessness
   is revealed,
   the man doomed to destruction.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-4" id="en-NIV-29666">

   He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God
   or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-5" id="en-NIV-29667">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-6" id="en-NIV-29668">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And now you know what is holding him back,
   so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-7" id="en-NIV-29669">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back
   will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-8" id="en-NIV-29670">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And then the lawless one will be revealed,
   whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth
   and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-9" id="en-NIV-29671">

   The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan
   works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders
   that serve the lie,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-10" id="en-NIV-29672">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing.
   They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-11" id="en-NIV-29673">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11

   For this reason God sends them
   a powerful delusion
   so that they will believe the lie
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Thess-2-12" id="en-NIV-29674">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.

   But we ought always to thank God for you,
   brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits
   to be saved
   through the sanctifying work of the Spirit
   and through belief in the truth.

   and hold fast to the teachings
   we passed on to you,
