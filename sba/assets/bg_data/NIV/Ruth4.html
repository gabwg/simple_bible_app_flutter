   Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate
   and sat down there just as the guardian-redeemer
   he had mentioned
   came along. Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down.

   Boaz took ten of the elders
   of the town and said, “Sit here,” and they did so.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-3" id="en-NIV-7194">

   Then he said to the guardian-redeemer, “Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-4" id="en-NIV-7195">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you
   will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you,
   and I am next in line.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-4">
   “I will redeem it,” he said.

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-5" id="en-NIV-7196">

   Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite,
   the
   dead man’s widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-6" id="en-NIV-7197">
   <sup class="versenum">

   At this, the guardian-redeemer said, “Then I cannot redeem
   it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-7" id="en-NIV-7198">

   (Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption
   and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal
   and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions
   in Israel.)

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-8" id="en-NIV-7199">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So the guardian-redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it yourself.” And he removed his sandal.

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-9" id="en-NIV-7200">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses
   that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelek, Kilion and Mahlon.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-10" id="en-NIV-7201">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite,
   Mahlon’s widow, as my wife,
   in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown.
   Today you are witnesses!

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-4-11" id="en-NIV-7202">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then the elders and all the people at the gate
   said, “We are witnesses.
   May the

    Lord

   So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he made love to her, the
