   Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married
   his daughter.
   He brought her to the City of David
   until he finished building his palace
   and the temple of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   The people, however, were still sacrificing at the high places,

   Solomon showed his love

   according to the instructions
   given him by his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.

   The king went to Gibeon
   to offer sacrifices, for that was the most important high place, and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.

   Solomon answered, “You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful
   to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son

   Your servant is here among the people you have chosen,

   So give your servant a discerning

   So God said to him, “Since you have asked
   for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment

  <span class="text 1Kgs-3-12" id="en-NIV-8829">

   I will do what you have asked.
