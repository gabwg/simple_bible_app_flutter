   In the year that the supreme commander,
   sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod
   and attacked and captured it—
  </span>
  <span class="text Isa-20-2" id="en-NIV-18032">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   at that time the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz.
   He said to him, “Take off the sackcloth
   from your body and the sandals
   from your feet.” And he did so, going around stripped
   and barefoot.

  <span class="text Isa-20-3" id="en-NIV-18033">

   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said, “Just as my servant
   Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years,
   as a sign
   and portent
   against Egypt
   and Cush,
  </span>
  <span class="text Isa-20-4" id="en-NIV-18034">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   so the king
   of Assyria will lead away stripped
   and barefoot the Egyptian captives
   and Cushite
   exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared
   —to Egypt’s shame.
  </span>
  <span class="text Isa-20-5" id="en-NIV-18035">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Those who trusted
   in Cush
   and boasted in Egypt
   will be dismayed and put to shame.

  <span class="text Isa-20-6" id="en-NIV-18036">
   <sup class="versenum">

   In that day
   the people who live on this coast will say, ‘See what has happened
   to those we relied on,
   those we fled to for help
   and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?
   ’”
