   The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin,
   traveling from place to place as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   commanded. They camped at Rephidim,
   but there was no water
   for the people to drink.

   So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water
   to drink.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-17-2">
   Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the

   But the people were thirsty
   for water there, and they grumbled
   against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die
   of thirst?”

   Then Moses cried out to the

   me.”

   The

   I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb.
   Strike
   the rock, and water
   will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.

   Moses said to Joshua,

   When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset.
