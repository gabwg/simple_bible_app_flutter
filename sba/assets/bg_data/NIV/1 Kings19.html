   Now Ahab told Jezebel
   everything Elijah had done and how he had killed
   all the prophets with the sword.

   So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely,
   if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.”

   Elijah was afraid
   and ran
   for his life.
   When he came to Beersheba
   in Judah, he left his servant there,

   while he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He came to a broom bush,
   sat down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough,
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ,” he said. “Take my life;
   I am no better than my ancestors.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-19-5" id="en-NIV-9393">

   Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep.

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-19-5">
   All at once an angel
   touched him and said, “Get up and eat.”

   He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.

   The angel of the

   came back a second time and touched him and said, “Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.”

   So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty
   days and forty nights until he reached Horeb,
   the mountain of God.

   Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael,

   Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. “Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,”
