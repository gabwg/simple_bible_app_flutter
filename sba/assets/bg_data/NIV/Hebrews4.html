   Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.

   For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.

   God again set a certain day, calling it “Today.” This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted:

   For the word of God
   is alive
   and active.
   Sharper than any double-edged sword,
   it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

   Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

   Therefore, since we have a great high priest
   who has ascended into heaven,
   Jesus the Son of God,

   who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are
