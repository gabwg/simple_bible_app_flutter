   In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the

   “Remember,
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   , how I have walked
   before you faithfully
   and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

   Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   came to him:

   “Go back and tell Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, ‘This is what the

   your prayer and seen your tears;

   Then Isaiah said, “Prepare a poultice of figs.” They did so and applied it to the boil,
   and he recovered.

   Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the

   will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the

   Isaiah answered, “This is the

   to you that the

   “It is a simple

   Hezekiah received the envoys and showed them all that was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices and the fine olive oil—his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.

   “From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They came from Babylon.”

   The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon.
