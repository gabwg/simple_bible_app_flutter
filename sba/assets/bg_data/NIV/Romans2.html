   You, therefore, have no excuse,
   you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-2-2" id="en-NIV-27965">

   Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.

  <span class="text Rom-2-3" id="en-NIV-27966">

   So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-2-4" id="en-NIV-27967">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Or do you show contempt for the riches
   of his kindness,
   forbearance
   and patience,
   not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?

  <span class="text Rom-2-5" id="en-NIV-27968">

   But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath
   , when his righteous judgment
   will be revealed.

   To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor

   But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil,

   There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil:
   first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-2-10" id="en-NIV-27973">

   All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law
   will be judged by the law.

   For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey
   the law who will be declared righteous.

  <span class="text Rom-2-14" id="en-NIV-27977">
   <sup class="versenum">

   (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law,
   they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.

   They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.)

   Circumcision has value if you observe the law,

   No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart,
