   Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan
   with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.

   The

   said to me, “Do not be afraid
   of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”

   So the

    Lord

   our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down,
   leaving no survivors.

   At that time we took all his cities.
   There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom
   in Bashan.
  </span>
  <span class="text Deut-3-5" id="en-NIV-4981">
   <sup class="versenum">

   All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.
  </span>
  <span class="text Deut-3-6" id="en-NIV-4982">
   <sup class="versenum">

   We completely destroyed
   them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying
   every city—men, women and children.

   But all the livestock

   So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites
   the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.

   We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah
   and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan.

   (Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites.

   Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer
   by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns.

  <span class="text Deut-3-13" id="en-NIV-4989">

   The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh.

   Jair,
   a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites;

   But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River,
   which is the border of the Ammonites.

   At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all that the
