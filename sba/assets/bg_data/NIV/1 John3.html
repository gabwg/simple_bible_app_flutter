   See what great love
   the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!
   And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.

   Dear friends,
   now we are children of God,
   and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears,
   we shall be like him,
   for we shall see him as he is.

   Dear children,
   do not let anyone lead you astray.
   The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.

   The one who does what is sinful is of the devil,

   appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.

   their brother and sister.
