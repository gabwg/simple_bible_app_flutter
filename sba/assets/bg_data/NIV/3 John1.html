   It gave me great joy when some believers

   So when I come,
   I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers.
   He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.

   Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good.
   Anyone who does what is good is from God.
   Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
