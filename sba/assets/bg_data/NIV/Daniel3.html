   King Nebuchadnezzar made an image
   of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide,
   and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-2" id="en-NIV-21810">

   He then summoned the satraps,
   prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials
   to come to the dedication of the image he had set up.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-3" id="en-NIV-21811">

   So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.

   Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “Nations and peoples of every language,
   this is what you are commanded to do:
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-5" id="en-NIV-21813">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp,
   pipe and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image
   of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-6" id="en-NIV-21814">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-7" id="en-NIV-21815">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

   At this time some astrologers
   came forward and denounced the Jews.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-9" id="en-NIV-21817">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever!
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-10" id="en-NIV-21818">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10

   Your Majesty has issued a decree
   that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold,
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-11" id="en-NIV-21819">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-12" id="en-NIV-21820">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
   —who pay no attention
   to you, Your Majesty. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-13" id="en-NIV-21821">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   Furious
   with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-14" id="en-NIV-21822">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods
   or worship the image
   of gold I have set up?
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-15" id="en-NIV-21823">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god
   will be able to rescue
   you from my hand?”

   Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
   replied to him, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-17" id="en-NIV-21825">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17

   If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver
   us from it, and he will deliver
   us
   from Your Majesty’s hand.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-18" id="en-NIV-21826">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.
   ”

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-19" id="en-NIV-21827">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven
   times hotter than usual
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-20" id="en-NIV-21828">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20

   and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
   and throw them into the blazing furnace.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-21" id="en-NIV-21829">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21

   So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-22" id="en-NIV-21830">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22

   The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-23" id="en-NIV-21831">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23

   and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-24" id="en-NIV-21832">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24

   Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, “Weren’t there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-24">
   They replied, “Certainly, Your Majesty.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-25" id="en-NIV-21833">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25

   He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-26" id="en-NIV-21834">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26
   </sup>
   Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God,
   come out! Come here!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-26">
   So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-27" id="en-NIV-21835">
   <sup class="versenum">
    27
   </sup>
   and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers
   crowded around them.
   They saw that the fire
   had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-28" id="en-NIV-21836">
   <sup class="versenum">
    28
   </sup>
   Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel
   and rescued
   his servants! They trusted
   in him and defied the king’s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-3-29" id="en-NIV-21837">
   <sup class="versenum">
    29
   </sup>
   Therefore I decree
   that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble,
   for no other god can save
   in this way.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-3-30" id="en-NIV-21838">

   Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
