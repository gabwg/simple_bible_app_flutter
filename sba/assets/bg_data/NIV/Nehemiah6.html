   When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah,
   Geshem
   the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates—

   Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages
   on the plain of Ono.

 <p>
  <span class="text Neh-6-2">
   But they were scheming to harm me;

   so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?”

    “It is reported among the nations—and Geshem

   One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple
   , and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you.”
