   After Rehoboam’s position as king was established
   and he had become strong,
   he and all Israel

   king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam.

   Then the prophet Shemaiah
   came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what the

   The leaders of Israel and the king humbled

   When the

   saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   came to Shemaiah: “Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance.
   My wrath

   When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields
   Solomon had made.

  <span class="text 2Chr-12-10" id="en-NIV-11448">

   So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.

   King Rehoboam established
   himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name.
   His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.

   As for the events of Rehoboam’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah
