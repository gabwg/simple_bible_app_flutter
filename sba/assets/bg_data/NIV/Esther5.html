   and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king’s

   When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.

   Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king’s gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence, he was filled with rage

   His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a pole set up, reaching to a height of fifty cubits,
