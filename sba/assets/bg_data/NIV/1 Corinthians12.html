   Now about the gifts of the Spirit,
   brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed.

   You know that when you were pagans,
   somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.

   Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,”
   and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,”
   except by the Holy Spirit.

   There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit

   There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone

   To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom,

   to another distinguishing between spirits,
   to another speaking in different kinds of tongues,

   Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body,

  <span class="text 1Cor-12-13" id="en-NIV-28648">

   For we were all baptized
   by
   one Spirit
   so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free

   Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.

   On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
