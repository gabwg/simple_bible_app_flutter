   David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash,
   just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.

   the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Hasn’t David sent them to you only to explore the city and spy it out
   and overthrow it?”

   cut off their garments at the buttocks,

   When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious
