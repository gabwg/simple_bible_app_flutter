   Now Dinah,
   the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.
  </span>

   When Shechem
   son of Hamor
   the Hivite,
   the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-34-3" id="en-NIV-984">

   His heart was drawn to Dinah
   daughter of Jacob;
   he loved
   the young woman and spoke tenderly
   to her.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-34-4" id="en-NIV-985">

   And Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-34-5" id="en-NIV-986">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled,
   his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home.

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-34-6" id="en-NIV-987">

   Then Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-34-7" id="en-NIV-988">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked
   and furious,
   because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in
   Israel
   by sleeping with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-34-8" id="en-NIV-989">

   But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.

   You can settle among us;

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-34-11" id="en-NIV-992">

   Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes,
   and I will give you whatever you ask.

  <span class="text Gen-34-12" id="en-NIV-993">

   Make the price for the bride

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-34-13" id="en-NIV-994">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   Because their sister Dinah had been defiled,
   Jacob’s sons replied deceitfully
   as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-34-14" id="en-NIV-995">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They said to them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised.
   That would be a disgrace to us.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-34-15" id="en-NIV-996">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15

   We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition
   only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-34-16" id="en-NIV-997">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves.

  <span class="text Gen-34-17" id="en-NIV-998">

   But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister and go.”

   Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.

   The young man, who was the most honored
   of all his father’s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.

  <span class="text Gen-34-20" id="en-NIV-1001">

   So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city
   to speak to the men of their city.

   “These men are friendly toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it;
   the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.

   But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised,

   Won’t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours?

  <span class="text Gen-34-24" id="en-NIV-1005">
   <sup class="versenum">

   All the men who went out of the city gate
   agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.

   Three days later, while all of them were still in pain,
   two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon
   and Levi,
   Dinah’s brothers, took their swords
   and attacked the unsuspecting city,
   killing every male.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-34-26" id="en-NIV-1007">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword

   The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city

   They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys

   They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children,

   Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble
   on me by making me obnoxious
   to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land.
   We are few in number,
   and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”
