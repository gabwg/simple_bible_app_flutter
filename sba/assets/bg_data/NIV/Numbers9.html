   The

    Lord

   spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month
   of the second year after they came out of Egypt.
   He said,
  </span>

   “Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover

  </span>
  <span class="text Num-9-5" id="en-NIV-3971">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and they did so in the Desert of Sinai
   at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month.
   The Israelites did everything just as the

   commanded Moses.

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Num-9-6" id="en-NIV-3972">

   But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean
   on account of a dead body.
   So they came to Moses and Aaron
   that same day
  </span>
  <span class="text Num-9-7" id="en-NIV-3973">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “Tell the Israelites: ‘When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body

   They must not leave any of it till morning

   But if anyone who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, they must be cut off from their people

   On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant law,

   the cloud
   covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire.
