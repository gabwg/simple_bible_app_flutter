   And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen
   who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.

   Now the glory
   of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim,
   where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the

   As I listened, he said to the others, “Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity

   Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain.

   While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown,
   crying out, “Alas, Sovereign
