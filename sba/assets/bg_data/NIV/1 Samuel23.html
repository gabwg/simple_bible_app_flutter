   When David was told, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah

   So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.

   Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has delivered him into my hands,

   David said, “

   David stayed in the wilderness

   Day after day Saul searched

   “Don’t be afraid,” he said. “My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king

   The Ziphites
   went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us

   So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon,

   Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.
