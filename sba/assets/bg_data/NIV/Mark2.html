   Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man

   A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-2" id="en-NIV-24263">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They gathered in such large numbers
   that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-3" id="en-NIV-24264">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man,
   carried by four of them.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-4" id="en-NIV-24265">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-5" id="en-NIV-24266">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,
   <span class="woj">
    “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-2-6" id="en-NIV-24267">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-7" id="en-NIV-24268">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-2-8" id="en-NIV-24269">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them,
   <span class="woj">
    “Why are you thinking these things?
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-9" id="en-NIV-24270">
   <span class="woj">
    <sup class="versenum">
     9
    </sup>
    Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’?
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-10" id="en-NIV-24271">
   <span class="woj">
    <sup class="versenum">
     10
    </sup>
    But I want you to know that the Son of Man
    has authority on earth to forgive sins.”
   </span>
   So he said to the man,
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-11" id="en-NIV-24272">
   <span class="woj">
    <sup class="versenum">
     11

    “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-12" id="en-NIV-24273">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12

   He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God,
   saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”

   Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners

  <span class="text Mark-2-13">

   Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him,
   and he began to teach them.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-14" id="en-NIV-24275">
   <sup class="versenum">

   As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth.
   <span class="woj">
    “Follow me,”
   </span>
   Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-2-15" id="en-NIV-24276">
   <sup class="versenum">

   While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Mark-2-16" id="en-NIV-24277">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees
   saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-2-17" id="en-NIV-24278">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17

   On hearing this, Jesus said to them,
   <span class="woj">
    “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

   Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting.
   Some people came and asked Jesus, “How is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?”

 <p>
  <span class="text Mark-2-19" id="en-NIV-24280">

   Jesus answered,

   One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
