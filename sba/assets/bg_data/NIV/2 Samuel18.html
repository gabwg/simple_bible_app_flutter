   David sent out his troops,

   But the men said, “You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won’t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won’t care; but you are worth ten

   It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.”

   Now Absalom happened to meet David’s men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom’s hair
   got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.

   During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King’s Valley
