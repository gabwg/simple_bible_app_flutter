   Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke
   me up, like someone awakened from sleep.
  </span>
  <span class="text Zech-4-2" id="en-NIV-22925">

   He asked me, “What do you see?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-2">
   I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand
   with a bowl at the top and seven lamps
   on it, with seven channels to the lamps.
  </span>
  <span class="text Zech-4-3" id="en-NIV-22926">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Also there are two olive trees
   by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-4" id="en-NIV-22927">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-5" id="en-NIV-22928">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   He answered, “Do you not know what these are?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-5">
   “No, my lord,” I replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-6" id="en-NIV-22929">

   So he said to me, “This is the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   to Zerubbabel:
   ‘Not
   by might nor by power,
   but by my Spirit,’
   says the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   Almighty.

 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-7" id="en-NIV-22930">

   “What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground.
   Then he will bring out the capstone
   to shouts
   of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’”

 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-8" id="en-NIV-22931">

   Then the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   came to me:
  </span>
  <span class="text Zech-4-9" id="en-NIV-22932">

   “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation
   of this temple; his hands will also complete it.
   Then you will know that the

   to you.

 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-10" id="en-NIV-22933">

   “Who dares despise the day
   of small things,
   since the seven eyes
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone
   in the hand of Zerubbabel?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-11" id="en-NIV-22934">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees

 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-12" id="en-NIV-22935">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12

   Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?”

 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-13" id="en-NIV-22936">

   He replied, “Do you not know what these are?”

  <span class="text Zech-4-13">
   “No, my lord,” I said.

 <p>
  <span class="text Zech-4-14" id="en-NIV-22937">

   So he said, “These are the two who are anointed
