   When all the work Solomon had done for the temple of the

   he brought in the things his father David had dedicated
   —the silver and gold and all the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of God’s temple.

   Then Solomon summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark
