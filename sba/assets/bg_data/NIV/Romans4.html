   Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised?
   We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.

   Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!

   And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised.
   So then, he is the father
   of all who believe
   but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.

   It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise
   that he would be heir of the world,

  <span class="text Rom-4-14" id="en-NIV-28037">

   For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless,

  <span class="text Rom-4-15" id="en-NIV-28038">

   Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace
   and may be guaranteed
   to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.

   As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.”

   Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead
