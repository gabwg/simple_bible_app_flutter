   Rehoboam went to Shechem,
   for all Israel had gone there to make him king.

   When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled
   from King Solomon), he returned from
   Egypt.

   So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:

   “Your father put a heavy yoke

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-12-5" id="en-NIV-9157">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three days and then come back to me.” So the people went away.

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-12-6" id="en-NIV-9158">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders
   who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-12-7" id="en-NIV-9159">

   They replied, “If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer,
   they will always be your servants.”

   But Rehoboam rejected
   the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.

  <span class="text 1Kgs-12-9" id="en-NIV-9161">

   He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”

   The young men who had grown up with him replied, “These people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.

  <span class="text 1Kgs-12-11" id="en-NIV-9163">

   My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’”

   Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.”

  <span class="text 1Kgs-12-13" id="en-NIV-9165">

   The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders,

   he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged

   So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the

   to fulfill the word the

   When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.
