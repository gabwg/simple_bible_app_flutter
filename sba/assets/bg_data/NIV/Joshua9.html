   Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things—the kings in the hill country,
   in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Mediterranean Sea
   as far as Lebanon
   (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
   Hivites
   and Jebusites)
   —

   they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel.

 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-3" id="en-NIV-6041">

   However, when the people of Gibeon
   heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-4" id="en-NIV-6042">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded
   with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-5" id="en-NIV-6043">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-6" id="en-NIV-6044">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal
   and said to him and the Israelites, “We have come from a distant country;
   make a treaty
   with us.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-7" id="en-NIV-6045">

   The Israelites said to the Hivites,
   “But perhaps you live near us, so how can we make a treaty
   with you?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-8" id="en-NIV-6046">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “We are your servants,
   ” they said to Joshua.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-8">
   But Joshua asked, “Who are you and where do you come from?”

 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-9" id="en-NIV-6047">

   They answered: “Your servants have come from a very distant country
   because of the fame of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God. For we have heard reports
   of him: all that he did in Egypt,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-10" id="en-NIV-6048">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon,
   and Og king of Bashan,
   who reigned in Ashtaroth.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-11" id="en-NIV-6049">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; make a treaty with us.”’
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-12" id="en-NIV-6050">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12

   This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-13" id="en-NIV-6051">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey.”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-14" id="en-NIV-6052">

   The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   .
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-15" id="en-NIV-6053">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   Then Joshua made a treaty of peace
   with them to let them live,
   and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-16" id="en-NIV-6054">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near
   them.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-17" id="en-NIV-6055">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth
   and Kiriath Jearim.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-18" id="en-NIV-6056">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18
   </sup>
   But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath
   to them by the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , the God of Israel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-18">
   The whole assembly grumbled
   against the leaders,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-19" id="en-NIV-6057">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19
   </sup>
   but all the leaders answered, “We have given them our oath by the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-20" id="en-NIV-6058">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that God’s wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath
   we swore to them.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-21" id="en-NIV-6059">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21
   </sup>
   They continued, “Let them live,
   but let them be woodcutters and water carriers
   in the service of the whole assembly.” So the leaders’ promise to them was kept.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-22" id="en-NIV-6060">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22
   </sup>
   Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by saying, ‘We live a long way
   from you,’ while actually you live near
   us?
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-23" id="en-NIV-6061">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23
   </sup>
   You are now under a curse:
   You will never be released from service as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-24" id="en-NIV-6062">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24
   </sup>
   They answered Joshua, “Your servants were clearly told
   how the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-25" id="en-NIV-6063">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25
   </sup>
   We are now in your hands.
   Do to us whatever seems good and right
   to you.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-9-26" id="en-NIV-6064">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-9-27" id="en-NIV-6065">
   <sup class="versenum">
    27
   </sup>
   That day he made the Gibeonites
   woodcutters and water carriers
   for the assembly, to provide for the needs of the altar of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   at the place the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   would choose.
   And that is what they are to this day.
