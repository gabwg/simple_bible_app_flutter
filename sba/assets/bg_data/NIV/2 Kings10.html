   Now there were in Samaria
   seventy sons
   of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel,
   to the elders and to the guardians
   of Ahab’s children. He said,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-2" id="en-NIV-9796">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “You have your master’s sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-3" id="en-NIV-9797">
   <sup class="versenum">

   choose the best and most worthy of your master’s sons and set him on his father’s throne. Then fight for your master’s house.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-4" id="en-NIV-9798">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But they were terrified and said, “If two kings could not resist him, how can we?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-5" id="en-NIV-9799">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants
   and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-6" id="en-NIV-9800">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master’s sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-6">
   Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-7" id="en-NIV-9801">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy
   of them. They put their heads
   in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.

  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-8" id="en-NIV-9802">

   When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the princes.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-8">
   Then Jehu ordered, “Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning.”

   The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?

  </span>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-11" id="en-NIV-9805">

   So Jehu
   killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.

   Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds,

   <sup class="versenum">

   he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-13">
   They said, “We are relatives of Ahaziah,

   “Take them alive!” he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked—forty-two of them. He left no survivor.

   After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab
   son of Rekab,
   who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, “Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-15">
   “I am,” Jehonadab answered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-15">
   “If so,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.”
   So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot.

   Jehu said, “Come with me and see my zeal

   When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab’s family;
   he destroyed them, according to the word of the

   Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served

   Now summon
   all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live.” But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.

  <span class="text 2Kgs-10-20" id="en-NIV-9814">

   Jehu said, “Call an assembly

   Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other.

   And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring robes for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them.

   Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around and see that no one who serves the

   So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: “If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life.”

   As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: “Go in and kill
   them; let no one escape.”
   So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal.
