   What shall we say, then?
   Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?

   By no means! We are those who have died to sin;
   how can we live in it any longer?

  <span class="text Rom-6-3" id="en-NIV-28072">

   Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized
   into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

   We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death
   in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead
   through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.

   For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.

   For we know that our old self
   was crucified with him
   so that the body ruled by sin
   might be done away with,
   that we should no longer be slaves to sin
   —

  <span class="text Rom-6-7" id="en-NIV-28076">

   The death he died, he died to sin

   In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin

   Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness,
   but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.

   Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey
   —whether you are slaves to sin,
   which leads to death,
   or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?

   But thanks be to God
   that, though you used to be slaves to sin,
   you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching
   that has now claimed your allegiance.

   I am using an example from everyday life
   because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness
   leading to holiness.

   But now that you have been set free from sin
   and have become slaves of God,
   the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.

   For the wages of sin is death,
   but the gift of God is eternal life

   Christ Jesus our Lord.
