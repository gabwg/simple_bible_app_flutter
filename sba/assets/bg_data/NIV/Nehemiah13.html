   On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God,

   because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam
   to call a curse down on them.
   (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.)

  <span class="text Neh-13-3" id="en-NIV-12675">

   When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent.

   Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms
   of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah,
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-13-5" id="en-NIV-12677">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes
   of grain, new wine and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests.

   But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes
   king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-13-7" id="en-NIV-12679">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib
   had done in providing Tobiah
   a room in the courts of the house of God.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-13-8" id="en-NIV-12680">

   I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-13-9" id="en-NIV-12681">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I gave orders to purify the rooms,
   and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense.

  <span class="text Neh-13-10" id="en-NIV-12682">

   I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them,
   and that all the Levites and musicians responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields.

  <span class="text Neh-13-11" id="en-NIV-12683">

   So I rebuked the officials and asked them, “Why is the house of God neglected?”
   Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts.

   All Judah brought the tithes
   of grain, new wine and olive oil into the storerooms.

  <span class="text Neh-13-13" id="en-NIV-12685">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because they were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites.

   In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath.
   Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day.

  <span class="text Neh-13-16" id="en-NIV-12688">

   People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath
   to the people of Judah.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-13-17" id="en-NIV-12689">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17

   I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this wicked thing you are doing—desecrating the Sabbath day?
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-13-18" id="en-NIV-12690">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   Didn’t your ancestors do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity on us and on this city?
   Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.”

  <span class="text Neh-13-19" id="en-NIV-12691">

   When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath,
   I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-13-20" id="en-NIV-12692">

   Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem.

  <span class="text Neh-13-21" id="en-NIV-12693">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But I warned them and said, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you.” From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath.
  </span>
  <span class="text Neh-13-22" id="en-NIV-12694">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.

 <p class="top-05">
  <span class="text Neh-13-22">
   Remember

   Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married
   women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.

   Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language
   of Judah.

  <span class="text Neh-13-25" id="en-NIV-12697">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25

   I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath
   in God’s name and said: “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves.

  <span class="text Neh-13-26" id="en-NIV-12698">

   Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him.
   He was loved by his God,
   and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women.

  <span class="text Neh-13-27" id="en-NIV-12699">

   Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying
   foreign women?”

   One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib
   the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat
   the Horonite. And I drove him away from me.

   Remember
   them, my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.

   So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign,

   I also made provision for contributions of wood
   at designated times, and for the firstfruits.
