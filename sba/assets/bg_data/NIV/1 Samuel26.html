   The Ziphites
   went to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding
   on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?
   ”

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-2" id="en-NIV-7908">

   So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand select Israelite troops, to search
   there for David.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-3" id="en-NIV-7909">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah
   facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had followed him there,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-4" id="en-NIV-7910">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived.

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-5" id="en-NIV-7911">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner
   son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-6" id="en-NIV-7912">
   <sup class="versenum">

   David then asked Ahimelek the Hittite
   and Abishai
   son of Zeruiah,
   Joab’s brother, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-6">
   “I’ll go with you,” said Abishai.

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-7" id="en-NIV-7913">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-8" id="en-NIV-7914">

   Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t strike him twice.”

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-9" id="en-NIV-7915">

   But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the

   As surely as the

   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   himself will strike
   him, or his time
   will come and he will die,
   or he will go into battle and perish.

  <span class="text 1Sam-26-11" id="en-NIV-7917">

   But the

   forbid that I should lay a hand on the

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-12" id="en-NIV-7918">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So David took the spear and water jug near Saul’s head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   had put them into a deep sleep.

 <p>

   Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them.

  <span class="text 1Sam-26-14" id="en-NIV-7920">

   He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Aren’t you going to answer me, Abner?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-14">
   Abner replied, “Who are you who calls to the king?”

   David said, “You’re a man, aren’t you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn’t you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.

  <span class="text 1Sam-26-16" id="en-NIV-7922">

   What you have done is not good. As surely as the

   Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is that your voice,
   David my son?”

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-26-17">
   David replied, “Yes it is, my lord the king.”

   Now let my lord the king listen
