   Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-5-2" id="en-NIV-26213">

   Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate
   a pool, which in Aramaic
   is called Bethesda
   and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-5-3" id="en-NIV-26214">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.

  <span class="text John-5-4" id="en-NIV-26215">

   One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-5-6" id="en-NIV-26217">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him,
   <span class="woj">
    “Do you want to get well?”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-5-7" id="en-NIV-26218">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7

   “Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-5-8" id="en-NIV-26219">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   Then Jesus said to him,
   <span class="woj">
    “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text John-5-9" id="en-NIV-26220">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9

   At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-5-9">
   The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,
  </span>
  <span class="text John-5-10" id="en-NIV-26221">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   and so the Jewish leaders
   said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-5-11" id="en-NIV-26222">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11

   But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me,
   <span class="woj">
    ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’
   </span>
   ”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-5-12" id="en-NIV-26223">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-5-13" id="en-NIV-26224">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-5-14" id="en-NIV-26225">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him,
   <span class="woj">
    “See, you are well again. Stop sinning
    or something worse may happen to you.”
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text John-5-15" id="en-NIV-26226">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The man went away and told the Jewish leaders
   that it was Jesus who had made him well.

  <span class="text John-5-16">

   So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-5-17" id="en-NIV-26228">
   <sup class="versenum">

   In his defense Jesus said to them,

    “My Father

  </span>
  <span class="text John-5-18" id="en-NIV-26229">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   For this reason they tried all the more to kill him;
   not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.

 <p>
  <span class="text John-5-19" id="en-NIV-26230">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19

   Jesus gave them this answer:
   <span class="woj">
    “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself;
    he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.

   <span class="woj">

  <span class="text John-5-22" id="en-NIV-26233">
   <span class="woj">
