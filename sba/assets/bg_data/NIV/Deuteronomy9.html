   Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan
   to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you,
   with large cities
   that have walls up to the sky.

   The people are strong and tall—Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: “Who can stand up against the Anakites?”

   But be assured today that the

   your God is the one who goes across ahead of you
   like a devouring fire.
   He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly,

   After the

   “The

   Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

  </span>
  <span class="text Deut-9-8" id="en-NIV-5166">

   At Horeb you aroused the

   When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant
   that the

   The

   gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God.
   On them were all the commandments the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.

  <span class="text Deut-9-11" id="en-NIV-5169">

   At the end of the forty days and forty nights,
   the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   gave me the two stone tablets,

   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   told me, “Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt.
   They have turned away quickly
   from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Deut-9-13" id="en-NIV-5171">

   And the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   said to me, “I have seen this people

   Let me alone,

 <p>
  <span class="text Deut-9-15" id="en-NIV-5173">

   So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.

  <span class="text Deut-9-16" id="en-NIV-5174">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf.
   You had turned aside quickly from the way that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

  </span>
  <span class="text Deut-9-17" id="en-NIV-5175">

   Then once again I fell

   I feared the anger and wrath of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   But again the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   listened to me.

  <span class="text Deut-9-21" id="en-NIV-5179">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust
   and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.

 <p>
  <span class="text Deut-9-22" id="en-NIV-5180">
