   This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   son of Josiah king of Judah:

   “Go to the Rekabite
   family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms

   So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the whole family of the Rekabites.

   I brought them into the house of the

   It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum

   Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.”

   But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab

   Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents.
   Then you will live a long time in the land
   where you are nomads.’

   But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded

   ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather’s command.

   Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets
   to you. They said, “Each of you must turn
   from your wicked ways and reform
   your actions; do not follow other gods
   to serve them. Then you will live in the land
   I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened
