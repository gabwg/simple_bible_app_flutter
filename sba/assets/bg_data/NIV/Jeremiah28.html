   In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah
   king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon,
   said to me in the house of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   in the presence of the priests and all the people:

   “This is what the

   Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles

  <span class="text Jer-28-4" id="en-NIV-19623">

   I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin
   son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the

   Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   He said, “Amen! May the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   do so! May the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:

  <span class="text Jer-28-8" id="en-NIV-19627">
   <sup class="versenum">

   From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague

  <span class="text Jer-28-9" id="en-NIV-19628">

   But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the

   only if his prediction comes true.

   Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke
   off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it,

   and he said
   before all the people, “This is what the

    Lord

   After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the

   “Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the

  <span class="text Jer-28-14" id="en-NIV-19633">
