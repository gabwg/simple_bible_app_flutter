   Samuel Anoints Saul

   There was a Benjamite,
   a man of standing,
   whose name was Kish
   son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-2" id="en-NIV-7394">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome
   a young man as could be found
   anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller
   than anyone else.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-3" id="en-NIV-7395">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Now the donkeys
   belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-4" id="en-NIV-7396">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   So he passed through the hill
   country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha,
   but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys
   were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-5" id="en-NIV-7397">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   When they reached the district of Zuph,
   Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come, let’s go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying
   about us.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-6" id="en-NIV-7398">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But the servant replied, “Look, in this town there is a man of God;
   he is highly respected, and everything
   he says comes true. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-7" id="en-NIV-7399">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   Saul said to his servant, “If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift
   to take to the man of God. What do we have?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-8" id="en-NIV-7400">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have a quarter of a shekel
   of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-9" id="en-NIV-7401">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   (Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire
   of God, they would say, “Come, let us go to the seer,” because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-10" id="en-NIV-7402">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   “Good,” Saul said to his servant. “Come, let’s go.” So they set out for the town where the man of God was.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-11" id="en-NIV-7403">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw
   water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-12" id="en-NIV-7404">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   “He is,” they answered. “He’s ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice
   at the high place.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-13" id="en-NIV-7405">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless
   the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-14" id="en-NIV-7406">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-15" id="en-NIV-7407">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Now the day before Saul came, the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had revealed this to Samuel:
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-16" id="en-NIV-7408">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   “About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint
   him ruler
   over my people Israel; he will deliver
   them from the hand of the Philistines.
   I have looked on my people, for their cry
   has reached me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-17" id="en-NIV-7409">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to him, “This
   is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-18" id="en-NIV-7410">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18
   </sup>
   Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-19" id="en-NIV-7411">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19
   </sup>
   “I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-20" id="en-NIV-7412">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   As for the donkeys
   you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire
   of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-21" id="en-NIV-7413">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21
   </sup>
   Saul answered, “But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe
   of Israel, and is not my clan the least
   of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin?
   Why do you say such a thing to me?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-22" id="en-NIV-7414">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22
   </sup>
   Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-23" id="en-NIV-7415">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23
   </sup>
   Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-24" id="en-NIV-7416">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24
   </sup>
   So the cook took up the thigh
   with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, ‘I have invited guests.’” And Saul dined with Samuel that day.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-25" id="en-NIV-7417">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25
   </sup>
   After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof
   of his house.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-26" id="en-NIV-7418">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26
   </sup>
   They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way.” When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-9-27" id="en-NIV-7419">
   <sup class="versenum">
    27
   </sup>
   As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant did so—“but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God.”
