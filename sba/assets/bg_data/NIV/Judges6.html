   Because the power of Midian was so oppressive,

   Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites

   They camped on the land and ruined the crops

   They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts.

   The angel of the

   came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah

   Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat,
   and from an ephah
   of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-20" id="en-NIV-6675">

   The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock,

   Then the angel of the

   touched the meat and the unleavened bread
   with the tip of the staff

   When Gideon realized

  <span class="text Judg-6-24" id="en-NIV-6679">

   So Gideon built an altar to the

   </span>
   there and called
   it The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   That same night the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   said to him, “Take the second bull from your father’s herd, the one seven years old.
   Tear down your father’s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole

  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-6-26" id="en-NIV-6681">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26

   Then build a proper kind of
   altar to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second
   bull as a burnt offering.

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-27" id="en-NIV-6682">

   So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-28" id="en-NIV-6683">
   <sup class="versenum">

   In the morning when the people of the town got up, there was Baal’s altar,
   demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-29" id="en-NIV-6684">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They asked each other, “Who did this?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-29">
   When they carefully investigated, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash
   did it.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-30" id="en-NIV-6685">
   <sup class="versenum">
    30

   The people of the town demanded of Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal’s altar
   and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-31" id="en-NIV-6686">
   <sup class="versenum">
    31

   But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, “Are you going to plead Baal’s cause?
   Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-6-32" id="en-NIV-6687">
   <sup class="versenum">
    32

   So because Gideon broke down Baal’s altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal
   that day, saying, “Let Baal contend with him.”

   Now all the Midianites, Amalekites

   Then the Spirit of the

   <sup class="versenum">

   He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher,
   Zebulun and Naphtali,

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-36" id="en-NIV-6691">

   Gideon said to God, “If you will save

   look, I will place a wool fleece
   on the threshing floor.
   If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know
   that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.”

  <span class="text Judg-6-38" id="en-NIV-6693">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-6-39" id="en-NIV-6694">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request.
   Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew.”

  <span class="text Judg-6-40" id="en-NIV-6695">

   That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.
