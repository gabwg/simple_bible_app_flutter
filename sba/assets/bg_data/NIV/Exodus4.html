   Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen
   to me and say, ‘The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   Then the

    Lord

   said to him, “What is that in your hand?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-4-2">
   “A staff,”
   he replied.

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-4-3">
   Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake,
   and he ran from it.

   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   said to him, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.

   “This,” said the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   , “is so that they may believe
   that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous
   —it had become as white as snow.

   “Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored,

   But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood

   Moses said to the

   Then the

   ’s anger burned
   against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet

  <span class="text Exod-4-15" id="en-NIV-1617">

   You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth;

   He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth

   Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-4-18">
   Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.”

   Now the

  <span class="text Exod-4-20" id="en-NIV-1622">

   So Moses took his wife and sons,
   put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff

   The

   said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders

   Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the

   At a lodging place on the way, the

   But Zipporah
   took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin

   “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-4-26" id="en-NIV-1628">

   So the

   let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.)

   The

   said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain

  <span class="text Exod-4-28" id="en-NIV-1630">
