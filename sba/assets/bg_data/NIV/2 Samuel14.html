   Joab
   son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart longed for Absalom.

   So Joab sent someone to Tekoa
   and had a wise woman
   brought from there. He said to her, “Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don’t use any cosmetic lotions.
   Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-14-3" id="en-NIV-8360">

   Then go to the king and speak these words to him.” And Joab
   put the words in her mouth.

   When the woman from Tekoa went
   to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, “Help me, Your Majesty!”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-14-5" id="en-NIV-8362">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The king asked her, “What is troubling you?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Sam-14-5">
   She said, “I am a widow; my husband is dead.

   I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-14-7" id="en-NIV-8364">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death
   for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir
   as well.’ They would put out the only burning coal I have left,
   leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth.”

  <span class="text 2Sam-14-8" id="en-NIV-8365">

   She said, “Then let the king invoke the

   his God to prevent the avenger
   of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed.”

   “As surely as the

   The woman said, “Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself,

  <span class="text 2Sam-14-14" id="en-NIV-8371">

   Like water

   The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.

   Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king.

   In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him.

   Whenever he cut the hair of his head

   Then he said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley

   Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent word to you and said, ‘Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come from Geshur?
   It would be better for me if I were still there!”’ Now then, I want to see the king’s face, and if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death.”
