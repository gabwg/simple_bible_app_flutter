   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart
   and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs

   that you may tell your children
   and grandchildren how I dealt harshly
   with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the

   So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   , the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble
   yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.

  <span class="text Exod-10-4" id="en-NIV-1782">
   <sup class="versenum">

   If you refuse
   to let them go, I will bring locusts

   They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left

   They will fill your houses

   Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.

   Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare
   to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship

   your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.”

   Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival

   Pharaoh said, “The

   be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.

   No! Have only the men go and worship the

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-10-13" id="en-NIV-1791">

   So Moses stretched out his staff
   over Egypt, and the

    Lord

   made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;

  <span class="text Exod-10-14" id="en-NIV-1792">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14

   they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts,

  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-10-15" id="en-NIV-1793">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15

   They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured
   all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.

 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-10-16" id="en-NIV-1794">

   Pharaoh quickly summoned
   Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned

   Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the

   And the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea.
   Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.

   Then the

   So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness

   No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
