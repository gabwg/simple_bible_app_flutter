   the anger of the

   So the king said to Joab

   and enroll
   the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are.”

   But Joab

    Lord

   your God multiply the troops a hundred times over,
   and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?”

   The king’s word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.

   After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer,

   Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.

   David was conscience-stricken
   after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   , “I have sinned

   Before David got up the next morning, the word of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   had come to Gad
   the prophet, David’s seer:
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Sam-24-12" id="en-NIV-8705">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “Go and tell David, ‘This is what the

   says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’”

  <span class="text 2Sam-24-13" id="en-NIV-8706">

   So Gad went to David and said to him, “Shall there come on you three
   years of famine
   in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague
   in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me.”

   David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the

   So the

   sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.

   When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the

   relented
   concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel of the

   On that day Gad went to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to the

   “To buy your threshing floor,” David answered, “so I can build an altar to the

   Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up. Here are oxen

   Your Majesty, Araunah
