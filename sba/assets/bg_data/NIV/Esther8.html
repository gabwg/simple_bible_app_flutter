   That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman,
   the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her.

   The king took off his signet ring,

   Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite,
   which he had devised against the Jews.

   “If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if he regards me with favor
   and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces.

   King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled

   Now write another decree

   At once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush.
   These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language.

   The king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children,

   the property of their enemies.
