   Because he had nine hundred chariots fitted with iron

   She held court

   She sent for Barak son of Abinoam

   There Barak summoned

   Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites,
   the descendants of Hobab,
   Moses’ brother-in-law,

   Sisera summoned from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River

   Then Deborah said to Barak, “Go! This is the day the

   Has not the

   At Barak’s advance, the

   Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot.

   Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all Sisera’s troops fell by the sword; not a man was left.

   Sisera, meanwhile, fled on foot to the tent of Jael,
   the wife of Heber the Kenite,

   Jael
   went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come, my lord, come right in. Don’t be afraid.” So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.

   “I’m thirsty,” he said. “Please give me some water.” She opened a skin of milk,

   But Jael,
   Heber’s wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep,
   exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.

   Just then Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael
   went out to meet him. “Come,” she said, “I will show you the man you’re looking for.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple—dead.
