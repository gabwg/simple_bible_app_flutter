   During the reign of David, there was a famine
   for three successive years; so David sought
   the face of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   The king summoned the Gibeonites
   and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.)

   David asked the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? How shall I make atonement so that you will bless the

   The Gibeonites answered him, “We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.”

   They answered the king, “As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel,

   But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah’s daughter Rizpah,

   He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed them and exposed their bodies on a hill before the
