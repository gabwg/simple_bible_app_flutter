   But the Israelites were unfaithful in regard to the devoted things
   ;
   Achan
   son of Karmi, the son of Zimri,
   the son of Zerah,
   of the tribe of Judah,
   took some of them. So the

   Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai,
   which is near Beth Aven
   to the east of Bethel,
   and told them, “Go up and spy out
   the region.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.

   When they returned to Joshua, they said, “Not all the army will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary the whole army, for only a few people live there.”

   So about three thousand went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,

  <span class="text Josh-7-5" id="en-NIV-5982">
   <sup class="versenum">

   who killed about thirty-six
   of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted in fear

   The elders of Israel

   did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us?

   Israel has sinned;
   they have violated my covenant,

   That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies;
   they turn their backs

   because they have been made liable to destruction.
   I will not be with you anymore

   When I saw in the plunder

   Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons
