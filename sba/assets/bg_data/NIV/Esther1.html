   This is what happened during the time of Xerxes,
   the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces
   stretching from India to Cush
   :

   and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet
   for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present.

   For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty.

   When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days,
   in the enclosed garden
   of the king’s palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa.

   The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches
   of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones.

   Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king’s liberality.

   On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits
   from wine,
   he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona,
   Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Karkas—

  <span class="text Esth-1-11" id="en-NIV-12714">

   to bring
   before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty
   to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at.

   But when the attendants delivered the king’s command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.

   Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times

   of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.

   “According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?” he asked. “She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her.”

  <span class="text Esth-1-16" id="en-NIV-12719">

   Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, “Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.

  <span class="text Esth-1-17" id="en-NIV-12720">

   For the queen’s conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, ‘King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.’

   This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen’s conduct will respond to all the king’s nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.

   “Therefore, if it pleases the king,
   let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed,
   that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.
