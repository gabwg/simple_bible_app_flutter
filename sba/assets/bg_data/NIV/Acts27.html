   When it was decided that we
   would sail for Italy,
   Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.

   We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia,
   and we put out to sea. Aristarchus,
   a Macedonian
   from Thessalonica,
   was with us.

   The next day we landed at Sidon;
   and Julius, in kindness to Paul,
   allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.

   From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.

   When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia
   and Pamphylia,
   we landed at Myra in Lycia.

   We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course,
   we sailed to the lee of Crete,
   opposite Salmone.
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-8" id="en-NIV-27864">

   We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.

   Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Day of Atonement.
   So Paul warned them,
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-10" id="en-NIV-27866">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   “Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-11" id="en-NIV-27867">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-12" id="en-NIV-27868">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete,
   facing both southwest and northwest.

   When a gentle south wind began to blow, they saw their opportunity; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-14" id="en-NIV-27870">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Before very long, a wind of hurricane force,
   called the Northeaster, swept down from the island.
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-15" id="en-NIV-27871">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15

   The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-16" id="en-NIV-27872">
   <sup class="versenum">

   As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat
   secure,
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-17" id="en-NIV-27873">
   <sup class="versenum">

   so the men hoisted it aboard. Then they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Because they were afraid they would run aground
   on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor
   and let the ship be driven along.
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-27-18" id="en-NIV-27874">
   <sup class="versenum">

   We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.

  <span class="text Acts-27-19" id="en-NIV-27875">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.

   After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice
   not to sail from Crete;
   then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.

  <span class="text Acts-27-22" id="en-NIV-27878">

   On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic
   Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.

   They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet
   deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet
   deep.

   Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.

  <span class="text Acts-27-30" id="en-NIV-27886">

   In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat
   down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.

  <span class="text Acts-27-31" id="en-NIV-27887">

   After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it

   When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.

   When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach,

   Cutting loose the anchors,
