   Now Naomi had a relative
   on her husband’s side, a man of standing
   from the clan of Elimelek,
   whose name was Boaz.

   And Ruth the Moabite
   said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain
   behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.
   ”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-2">
   Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.”

   So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters.
   As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek.

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-4" id="en-NIV-7154">

   Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “The

   “The

  <span class="text Ruth-2-5" id="en-NIV-7155">

   Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, “Who does that young woman belong to?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-6" id="en-NIV-7156">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The overseer replied, “She is the Moabite
   who came back from Moab with Naomi.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-7" id="en-NIV-7157">

   She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves
   behind the harvesters.’ She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest
   in the shelter.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-8" id="en-NIV-7158">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Boaz said to Ruth, “My daughter, listen to me. Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me.

  <span class="text Ruth-2-9" id="en-NIV-7159">

   Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-10" id="en-NIV-7160">

   At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground.
   She asked him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me
   —a foreigner?

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-11" id="en-NIV-7161">

   Boaz replied, “I’ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law
   since the death of your husband
   —how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know
   before.

   the God of Israel,

   “May I continue to find favor in your eyes,
   my lord,” she said. “You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-14" id="en-NIV-7164">

   At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Have some bread
   and dip it in the wine vinegar.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-14">
   When she sat down with the harvesters,
   he offered her some roasted grain.
   She ate all she wanted and had some left over.

  <span class="text Ruth-2-15" id="en-NIV-7165">
   <sup class="versenum">

   As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, “Let her gather among the sheaves
   and don’t reprimand her.

   Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don’t rebuke

   So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed
   the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-18" id="en-NIV-7168">
   <sup class="versenum">

   She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over
   after she had eaten enough.

 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-19" id="en-NIV-7169">

   Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!
   ”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ruth-2-19">
   Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said.

   “He has not stopped showing his kindness
   to the living and the dead.” She added, “That man is our close relative;
   he is one of our guardian-redeemers.

   Then Ruth the Moabite
   said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.’”

   Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else’s field you might be harmed.”

   So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley
   and wheat harvests
   were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
