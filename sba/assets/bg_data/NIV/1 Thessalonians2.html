   You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you
   was not without results.

   We had previously suffered
   and been treated outrageously in Philippi,
   as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-2-3" id="en-NIV-29574">

   For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives,
   nor are we trying to trick you.

   On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel.
   We are not trying to please people
   but God, who tests our hearts.

   You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed
   —God is our witness.

   We were not looking for praise from people,
   not from you or anyone else, even though as apostles
   of Christ we could have asserted our authority.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-2-7" id="en-NIV-29578">

   Instead, we were like young children
   among you.

  <span class="text 1Thess-2-7">
   Just as a nursing mother cares for her children,

   so we cared for you. Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God
   but our lives as well.

   Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked
   night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone

   You are witnesses,
   and so is God,

   For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,

   And we also thank God continually
   because, when you received the word of God,
   which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe.

   For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators
   of God’s churches in Judea,
   which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people
   the same things those churches suffered from the Jews

   so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit.
   The wrath of God has come upon them at last.

   But, brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time (in person, not in thought),
