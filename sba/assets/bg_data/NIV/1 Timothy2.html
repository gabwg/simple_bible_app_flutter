   I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers,
   intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-2" id="en-NIV-29719">
   <sup class="versenum">
    2
   </sup>
   for kings and all those in authority,
   that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness
   and holiness.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-3" id="en-NIV-29720">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   This is good, and pleases
   God our Savior,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-4" id="en-NIV-29721">
   <sup class="versenum">
    4

   who wants
   all people
   to be saved
   and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-5" id="en-NIV-29722">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   For there is one God
   and one mediator
   between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-6" id="en-NIV-29723">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   who gave himself as a ransom
   for all people. This has now been witnessed to
   at the proper time.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-7" id="en-NIV-29724">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7

   And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying
   —and a true and faithful teacher
   of the Gentiles.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-8" id="en-NIV-29725">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands
   without anger or disputing.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-9" id="en-NIV-29726">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-10" id="en-NIV-29727">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10

   but with good deeds,
   appropriate for women who profess to worship God.

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-11" id="en-NIV-29728">
   <sup class="versenum">

   A woman
   should learn in quietness and full submission.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-12" id="en-NIV-29729">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12

   I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;
   she must be quiet.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-13" id="en-NIV-29730">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13

   For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-14" id="en-NIV-29731">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Tim-2-15" id="en-NIV-29732">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But women
   will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love
   and holiness with propriety.
