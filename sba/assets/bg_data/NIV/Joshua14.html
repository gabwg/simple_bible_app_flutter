   Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance
   in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar
   the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel
   allotted
   to them.

   Their inheritances were assigned by lot
   to the nine and a half tribes,
   as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   had commanded through Moses.

   Moses had granted the two and a half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan
   but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest,

  <span class="text Josh-14-4" id="en-NIV-6192">

   for Joseph’s descendants had become two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim.
   The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.

  <span class="text Josh-14-5" id="en-NIV-6193">

   So the Israelites divided the land, just as the

   Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal,
   and Caleb son of Jephunneh
   the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Moses the man of God
   at Kadesh Barnea
   about you and me.

  <span class="text Josh-14-7" id="en-NIV-6195">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   sent me from Kadesh Barnea
   to explore the land.
   And I brought him back a report according to my convictions,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-14-8" id="en-NIV-6196">
   <sup class="versenum">

   but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear.
   I, however, followed the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   my God wholeheartedly.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-14-9" id="en-NIV-6197">

   So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance
   and that of your children
   forever, because you have followed the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   “Now then, just as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   promised,
   he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved
   about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old!

  <span class="text Josh-14-11" id="en-NIV-6199">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I am still as strong
   today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous
   to go out to battle now as I was then.

   Now give me this hill country that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   promised me that day.
   You yourself heard then that the Anakites
   were there and their cities were large and fortified,
   but, the

   Then Joshua blessed
   Caleb son of Jephunneh
   and gave him Hebron
   as his inheritance.

  <span class="text Josh-14-14" id="en-NIV-6202">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the

    Lord
