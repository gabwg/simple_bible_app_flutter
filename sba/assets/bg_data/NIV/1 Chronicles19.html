   In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites
   died, and his son succeeded him as king.

   David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.

  <span class="text 1Chr-19-2">
   When David’s envoys came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him,

   the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Haven’t his envoys come to you only to explore and spy out
   the country and overthrow it?”

   When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.”

   When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious

   of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim,
   Aram Maakah and Zobah.

   They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maakah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba,

   Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.

   After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophak the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
