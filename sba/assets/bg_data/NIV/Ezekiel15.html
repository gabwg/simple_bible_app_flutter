   The word of the

   came to me:

  <span class="text Ezek-15-2" id="en-NIV-20757">

   “Son of man, how is the wood of a vine
   different from that of a branch from any of the trees in the forest?
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-15-3" id="en-NIV-20758">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful?
   Do they make pegs
   from it to hang things on?

  <span class="text Ezek-15-4" id="en-NIV-20759">

   And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything?

   <sup class="versenum">

   If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?

   “Therefore this is what the Sovereign
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem.

   I will set my face against
   them. Although they have come out of the fire
   , the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the
