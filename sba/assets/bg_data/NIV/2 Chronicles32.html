   After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib
   king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself.

   When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage war against Jerusalem,

   he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him.

   They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs
   and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings
   of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said.

   Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall
   and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces
   of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons
   and shields.

   He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:
