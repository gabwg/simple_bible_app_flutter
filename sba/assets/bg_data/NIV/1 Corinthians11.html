   On Covering the Head in Worship

   I praise you
   for remembering me in everything
   and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.

   But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ,
   and the head of the woman is man,
   and the head of Christ is God.

  <span class="text 1Cor-11-4" id="en-NIV-28605">

   Every man who prays or prophesies
   with his head covered dishonors his head.

  <span class="text 1Cor-11-5" id="en-NIV-28606">

   But every woman who prays or prophesies
   with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-6" id="en-NIV-28607">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6

   For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-7" id="en-NIV-28608">

   A man ought not to cover his head,
   since he is the image
   and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-8" id="en-NIV-28609">

   For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;

   neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.

  <span class="text 1Cor-11-10" id="en-NIV-28611">
   <sup class="versenum">

   It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own
   head, because of the angels.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-11" id="en-NIV-28612">

   Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

   Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,

  <span class="text 1Cor-11-15" id="en-NIV-28616">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Correcting an Abuse of the Lord’s Supper

  <span class="text 1Cor-11-17">

   In the following directives I have no praise for you,
   for your meetings do more harm than good.

   In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions
   among you, and to some extent I believe it.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-19" id="en-NIV-28620">
   <sup class="versenum">

   No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval.

   So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-21" id="en-NIV-28622">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21

   for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers.
   As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-22" id="en-NIV-28623">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22
   </sup>
   Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God
   by humiliating those who have nothing?
   What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you?
   Certainly not in this matter!

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-23" id="en-NIV-28624">
   <sup class="versenum">

   For I received from the Lord
   what I also passed on to you:
   The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-24" id="en-NIV-28625">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24
   </sup>
   and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
   <span class="woj">
    “This is my body,
    which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-25" id="en-NIV-28626">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25

   In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying,
   <span class="woj">
    “This cup is the new covenant
    in my blood;
    do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-26" id="en-NIV-28627">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26

   For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-27" id="en-NIV-28628">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-28" id="en-NIV-28629">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Everyone ought to examine themselves
   before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup.

  <span class="text 1Cor-11-29" id="en-NIV-28630">

   For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.

   That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.

   But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-11-32" id="en-NIV-28633">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined
   so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.

   So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together.

   Anyone who is hungry
   should eat something at home,
   so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.

   And when I come
