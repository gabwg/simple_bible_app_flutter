   When Jabin
   king of Hazor
   heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron
   and Akshaph,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-2" id="en-NIV-6110">

   and to the northern kings who were in the mountains, in the Arabah
   south of Kinnereth,
   in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor
   on the west;
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-3" id="en-NIV-6111">
   <sup class="versenum">

   to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites
   and Jebusites in the hill country;
   and to the Hivites
   below Hermon
   in the region of Mizpah.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-4" id="en-NIV-6112">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots—a huge army, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-5" id="en-NIV-6113">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   All these kings joined forces
   and made camp together at the Waters of Merom
   to fight against Israel.
  </span>

   The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, because by this time tomorrow I will hand
   all of them, slain, over to Israel. You are to hamstring
   their horses and burn their chariots.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-11-7" id="en-NIV-6115">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-8" id="en-NIV-6116">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   and the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   gave them into the hand of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon,
   to Misrephoth Maim,
   and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east, until no survivors were left.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-9" id="en-NIV-6117">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9

   Joshua did to them as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had directed: He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-11-10" id="en-NIV-6118">
   <sup class="versenum">

   At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword.
   (Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.)
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-11" id="en-NIV-6119">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed
   them,
   not sparing anyone that breathed,
   and he burned
   Hazor itself.

 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-11-12" id="en-NIV-6120">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had commanded.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-13" id="en-NIV-6121">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds—except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-14" id="en-NIV-6122">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-15" id="en-NIV-6123">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   As the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it; he left nothing undone of all that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   commanded Moses.

 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-11-16" id="en-NIV-6124">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16

   So Joshua took this entire land: the hill country,
   all the Negev,
   the whole region of Goshen, the western foothills,
   the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills,
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-17" id="en-NIV-6125">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir,
   to Baal Gad
   in the Valley of Lebanon
   below Mount Hermon.
   He captured all their kings and put them to death.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-18" id="en-NIV-6126">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-19" id="en-NIV-6127">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19
   </sup>
   Except for the Hivites
   living in Gibeon,
   not one city made a treaty of peace
   with the Israelites, who took them all in battle.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-20" id="en-NIV-6128">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   For it was the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   himself who hardened their hearts
   to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had commanded Moses.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-11-21" id="en-NIV-6129">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21
   </sup>
   At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites
   from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir
   and Anab,
   from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns.
  </span>
  <span class="text Josh-11-22" id="en-NIV-6130">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22

   No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza,
   Gath
   and Ashdod
   did any survive.

 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-11-23" id="en-NIV-6131">

   So Joshua took the entire land,
   just as the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   had directed Moses, and he gave it as an inheritance
   to Israel according to their tribal divisions.
   Then the land had rest
   from war.
