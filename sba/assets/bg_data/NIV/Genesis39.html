   Now Joseph
   had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard,
   bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.

   The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   was with Joseph
   so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.

   When his master saw that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   was with him
   and that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   gave him success in everything he did,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-4" id="en-NIV-1154">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Joseph found favor in his eyes
   and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household,
   and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-5" id="en-NIV-1155">
   <sup class="versenum">

   From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   blessed the household
   of the Egyptian because of Joseph.
   The blessing of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-6" id="en-NIV-1156">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care;
   with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-39-6">
   Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-7" id="en-NIV-1157">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to bed with me!”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-39-8" id="en-NIV-1158">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But he refused.
   “With me in charge,” he told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-9" id="en-NIV-1159">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9

   No one is greater in this house than I am.
   My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-10" id="en-NIV-1160">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10

   And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused
   to go to bed with her or even be with her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-39-11" id="en-NIV-1161">
   <sup class="versenum">

   One day he went into the house to attend to his duties,
   and none of the household servants
   was inside.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-12" id="en-NIV-1162">
   <sup class="versenum">

   She caught him by his cloak
   and said, “Come to bed with me!”
   But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-39-13" id="en-NIV-1163">

   When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-14" id="en-NIV-1164">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   she called her household servants.
   “Look,” she said to them, “this Hebrew
   has been brought to us to make sport of us!
   He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-15" id="en-NIV-1165">
   <sup class="versenum">

   When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-39-16" id="en-NIV-1166">
   <sup class="versenum">

   She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-17" id="en-NIV-1167">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   Then she told him this story:
   “That Hebrew
   slave
   you brought us came to me to make sport of me.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-18" id="en-NIV-1168">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18

   But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-39-19" id="en-NIV-1169">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19
   </sup>
   When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with anger.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-20" id="en-NIV-1170">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20

   Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison,
   the place where the king’s prisoners were confined.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-39-20">
   But while Joseph was there in the prison,

   the

   he showed him kindness

  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-22" id="en-NIV-1172">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-39-23" id="en-NIV-1173">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23

   The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s
   care, because the

    Lord
   </span>
   was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.
