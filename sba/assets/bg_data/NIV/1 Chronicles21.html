   Satan
   rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census

   So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count
   the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are.”

   But Joab replied, “May the

   multiply his troops a hundred times over.
   My lord the king, are they not all my lord’s subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”

   The king’s word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.

   Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel
   there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.
