   Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   : twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated

   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   So Solomon observed the festival

   to the Wadi of Egypt.
   They celebrated it before the

   things the
