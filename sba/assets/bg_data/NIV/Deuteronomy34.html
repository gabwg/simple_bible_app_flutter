   Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo
   from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah,
   across from Jericho.
   There the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   showed
   him the whole land—from Gilead to Dan,

   all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea,

   Then the

   said to him, “This is the land I promised on oath
   to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob

   over into it.”

   And Moses the servant of the

   died
   there in Moab, as the

   He buried him

   Moses was a hundred and twenty years old

   The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab

   Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit
   of wisdom
   because Moses had laid his hands on him.
   So the Israelites listened to him and did what the
