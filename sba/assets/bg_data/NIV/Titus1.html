   Appointing Elders Who Love What Is Good

   The reason I left you in Crete
   was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint
   elders
   in every town, as I directed you.
  </span>
  <span class="text Titus-1-6" id="en-NIV-29899">
   <sup class="versenum">

   An elder must be blameless,
   faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe
   and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.

  <span class="text Titus-1-7" id="en-NIV-29900">

   Since an overseer
   manages God’s household,
   he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.
  </span>
  <span class="text Titus-1-8" id="en-NIV-29901">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Rather, he must be hospitable,
   one who loves what is good,
   who is self-controlled,
   upright, holy and disciplined.

   He must hold firmly
   to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine
   and refute those who oppose it.

   They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households

   One of Crete’s own prophets

   To the pure, all things are pure,
   but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure.
   In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.
