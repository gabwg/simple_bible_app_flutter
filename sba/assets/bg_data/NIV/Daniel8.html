   Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat

   In the third year of King Belshazzar’s
   reign, I, Daniel, had a vision,
   after the one that had already appeared to me.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-2" id="en-NIV-21964">
   <sup class="versenum">

   In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa
   in the province of Elam;
   in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-3" id="en-NIV-21965">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I looked up,
   and there before me was a ram
   with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-4" id="en-NIV-21966">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power.
   It did as it pleased
   and became great.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-8-5" id="en-NIV-21967">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-6" id="en-NIV-21968">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-7" id="en-NIV-21969">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it,
   and none could rescue the ram from its power.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-8" id="en-NIV-21970">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off,
   and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-8-9" id="en-NIV-21971">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Out of one of them came another horn, which started small
   but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-10" id="en-NIV-21972">
   <sup class="versenum">

   It grew until it reached
   the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth
   and trampled
   on them.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-11" id="en-NIV-21973">
   <sup class="versenum">

   It set itself up to be as great as the commander
   of the army of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ;
   it took away the daily sacrifice
   from the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , and his sanctuary was thrown down.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-12" id="en-NIV-21974">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12

   Because of rebellion, the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ’s people
   and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-8-13" id="en-NIV-21975">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   Then I heard a holy one
   speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled
   —the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   ’s people?”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-8-14" id="en-NIV-21976">

   He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.”

   While I, Daniel, was watching the vision
   and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man.
  </span>
  <span class="text Dan-8-16" id="en-NIV-21978">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16

   And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai
   calling, “Gabriel,
   tell this man the meaning of the vision.”

  <span class="text Dan-8-17" id="en-NIV-21979">

   As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate.
   “Son of man,”
   he said to me, “understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-8-18" id="en-NIV-21980">

   While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground.
   Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.

 <p>
  <span class="text Dan-8-19" id="en-NIV-21981">

   He said: “I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath,
   because the vision concerns the appointed time

   The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.

   The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.

   He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people.

   He will cause deceit
   to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes.
   Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.

   I, Daniel, was worn out. I lay exhausted
   for several days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business.
   I was appalled
   by the vision; it was beyond understanding.
