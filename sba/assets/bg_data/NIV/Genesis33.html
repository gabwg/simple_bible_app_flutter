   Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men;
   so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants.

   He put the female servants and their children
   in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph
   in the rear.

   He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground
   seven times
   as he approached his brother.

   But Esau
   ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him.
   And they wept.

   Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-33-5">
   Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.

   Next, Leah and her children

   Last of all came Joseph and Rachel,

   Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-33-8">
   “To find favor in your eyes, my lord,”
   he said.

   “No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes,
   accept this gift
   from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God,
   now that you have received me favorably.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-33-11" id="en-NIV-972">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11

   Please accept the present
   that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me
   and I have all I need.”
   And because Jacob insisted,
   Esau accepted it.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-33-12" id="en-NIV-973">

   But Jacob said to him, “My lord
   knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young.
   If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-33-14" id="en-NIV-975">

   So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds
   before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.

  <span class="text Gen-33-15" id="en-NIV-976">

   Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-33-15">
   “But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”

   Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth,

   For a hundred pieces of silver,
