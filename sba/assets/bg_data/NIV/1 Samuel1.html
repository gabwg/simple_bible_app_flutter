   There was a certain man from Ramathaim,
   a Zuphite
   from the hill country
   of Ephraim,
   whose name was Elkanah
   son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.

   He had two wives;
   one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.

   Year after year
   this man went up from his town to worship
   and sacrifice to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   Almighty at Shiloh,
   where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli,
   were priests of the

   Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice,
   he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.

   But to Hannah he gave a double portion
   because he loved her, and the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   had closed her womb.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-1-6" id="en-NIV-7219">

   Because the

   had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Sam-1-7" id="en-NIV-7220">

   This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the

   Her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?

   Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the

   In her deep anguish
   Hannah prayed to the

  <span class="text 1Sam-1-11" id="en-NIV-7224">

   And she made a vow,
   saying, “

   Almighty
   , if you will only look on your servant’s misery and remember
   me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the

   As she kept on praying to the

   Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk

   “Not so, my lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply troubled.
   I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring
   out my soul to the

   Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the

   So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son.
   She named

   Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present

   “Do what seems best to you,” her husband Elkanah told her. “Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the

   After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull,
   an ephah
   of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the
