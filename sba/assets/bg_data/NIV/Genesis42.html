   When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt,
   he said to his sons, “Why do you just keep looking at each other?”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-42-2" id="en-NIV-1255">

   He continued, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us,
   so that we may live and not die.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-42-3" id="en-NIV-1256">

   Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain
   from Egypt.

  <span class="text Gen-42-4" id="en-NIV-1257">

   But Jacob did not send Benjamin,
   Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.

  <span class="text Gen-42-5" id="en-NIV-1258">

   So Israel’s sons were among those who went to buy grain,
   for there was famine in the land of Canaan
   also.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-42-6" id="en-NIV-1259">

   Now Joseph was the governor of the land,
   the person who sold grain to all its people.
   So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.

  <span class="text Gen-42-7" id="en-NIV-1260">

   As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them.
   “Where do you come from?”
   he asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-42-7">
   “From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to buy food.”

   Then he remembered his dreams
   about them and said to them, “You are spies!

   “No, my lord,

   Send one of your number to get your brother;

   If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!

   They said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother.

   Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain,
