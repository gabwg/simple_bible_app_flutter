   These are the names of the sons of Israel
   who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:

   The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy

   Joseph was already in Egypt.

   Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,

  <span class="text Exod-1-7" id="en-NIV-1540">

   but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers
   and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.

   Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.

   “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous
   for us.

  <span class="text Exod-1-10" id="en-NIV-1543">

   Come, we must deal shrewdly
   with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”

   So they put slave masters
   over them to oppress them with forced labor,
   and they built Pithom and Rameses
   as store cities

   But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites

   They made their lives bitter with harsh labor
   in brick
   and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.

   The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives,
   whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-1-16" id="en-NIV-1549">
   <sup class="versenum">

   “When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”

  <span class="text Exod-1-17" id="en-NIV-1550">
   <sup class="versenum">

   The midwives, however, feared
   God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do;
   they let the boys live.

  <span class="text Exod-1-18" id="en-NIV-1551">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”

   The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”

   So God was kind to the midwives
   and the people increased and became even more numerous.

   And because the midwives feared
   God, he gave them families
   of their own.

   Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile,
