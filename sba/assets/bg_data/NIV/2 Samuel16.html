   When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba,
   the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine.

   Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh
   those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”

   As King David approached Bahurim,
   a man from the same clan as Saul’s family came out from there. His name was Shimei
   son of Gera, and he cursed
   as he came out.

  <span class="text 2Sam-16-6" id="en-NIV-8433">

   He pelted David and all the king’s officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David’s right and left.

   Then Abishai

  <span class="text 2Sam-16-10" id="en-NIV-8437">

   If he is cursing because the

   Ahithophel answered, “Sleep with your father’s concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself obnoxious to your father, and the hands of everyone with you will be more resolute.”

  <span class="text 2Sam-16-22" id="en-NIV-8449">

   So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.

   Now in those days the advice
   Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David
