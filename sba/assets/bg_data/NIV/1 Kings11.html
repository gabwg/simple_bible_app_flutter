   King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women
   besides Pharaoh’s daughter—Moabites, Ammonites,
   Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.

   They were from nations about which the

   had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry
   with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.” Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.

   As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods,
   and his heart was not fully devoted
   to the

   So Solomon did evil

   On a hill east

   The

   Solomon did not keep the

  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-11-11" id="en-NIV-9120">

   So the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   said to Solomon, “Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees,
   which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear
   the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-11-12" id="en-NIV-9121">

   Nevertheless, for the sake of David

   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   raised up against Solomon an adversary,
   Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.

   Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom.

  <span class="text 1Kgs-11-16" id="en-NIV-9125">

  <span class="text 1Kgs-11-18" id="en-NIV-9127">
   <sup class="versenum">

   They set out from Midian and went to Paran.
   Then taking people from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Kgs-11-19" id="en-NIV-9128">

   Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.

   While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.”

   And God raised up against Solomon another adversary,
   Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer
   king of Zobah.

  <span class="text 1Kgs-11-24" id="en-NIV-9133">

   When David destroyed Zobah’s army, Rezon gathered a band of men around him and became their leader; they went to Damascus,
