   Dear friends,
   this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders
   to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-2" id="en-NIV-30525">

   I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets
   and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-3" id="en-NIV-30526">

   Above all, you must understand that in the last days
   scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.

  <span class="text 2Pet-3-4" id="en-NIV-30527">

   They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised?
   Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-5" id="en-NIV-30528">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s word
   the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-6" id="en-NIV-30529">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   By these waters also the world of that time
   was deluged and destroyed.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-7" id="en-NIV-30530">
   <sup class="versenum">

   By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire,
   being kept for the day of judgment
   and destruction of the ungodly.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-8" id="en-NIV-30531">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.

  <span class="text 2Pet-3-9" id="en-NIV-30532">

   The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise,
   as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient
   with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-10" id="en-NIV-30533">

   But the day of the Lord will come like a thief.
   The heavens will disappear with a roar;
   the elements will be destroyed by fire,
   and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-11" id="en-NIV-30534">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-12" id="en-NIV-30535">
   <sup class="versenum">

   as you look forward
   to the day of God and speed its coming.
   That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.

  <span class="text 2Pet-3-13" id="en-NIV-30536">

   But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth,
   where righteousness dwells.

   So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless
   and at peace with him.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Pet-3-15" id="en-NIV-30538">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience
   means salvation,
   just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.

   He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable
   people distort,
   as they do the other Scriptures,
   to their own destruction.

   Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard
   so that you may not be carried away by the error
   of the lawless
   and fall from your secure position.

   But grow in the grace
   and knowledge
   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
   To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.
