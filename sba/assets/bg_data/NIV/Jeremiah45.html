   When Baruch
   son of Neriah
   wrote on a scroll
   the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
   son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah said this to Baruch:
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-45-2" id="en-NIV-20043">
   <sup class="versenum">
    2
   </sup>
   “This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-45-3" id="en-NIV-20044">
   <sup class="versenum">
    3
   </sup>
   You said, ‘Woe
   to me! The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has added sorrow
   to my pain;
   I am worn out with groaning
   and find no rest.’
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-45-4" id="en-NIV-20045">
   <sup class="versenum">
    4
   </sup>
   But the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has told me to say to you, ‘This is what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot
   what I have planted,
   throughout the earth.
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-45-5" id="en-NIV-20046">

   Should you then seek great
   things for yourself? Do not seek them.
   For I will bring disaster
   on all people,
   declares the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , but wherever you go I will let you escape
   with your life.’”
