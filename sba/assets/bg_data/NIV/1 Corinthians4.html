   This, then, is how you ought to regard us: as servants
   of Christ and as those entrusted
   with the mysteries
   God has revealed.

   Therefore judge nothing
   before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes.
   He will bring to light
   what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.

   Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, “Do not go beyond what is written.”
   Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other.

   For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like those condemned to die
   in the arena. We have been made a spectacle
   to the whole universe, to angels as well as to human beings.
