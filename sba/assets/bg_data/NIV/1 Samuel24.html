   After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.

   So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look
   for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.

   He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave
   was there, and Saul went in to relieve
   himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.

   of when he said

   Then David crept up unnoticed and cut
   off a corner of Saul’s robe.
