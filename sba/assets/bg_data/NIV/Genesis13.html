   So Abram went up from Egypt
   to the Negev,
   with his wife and everything he had, and Lot
   went with him.

   Abram had become very wealthy
   in livestock
   and in silver and gold.

   From the Negev
   he went from place to place until he came to Bethel,
   to the place between Bethel and Ai

   and where he had first built an altar.
   There Abram called on the name of the

   Now Lot,
   who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.

   But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.

   And quarreling
   arose between Abram’s herders and Lot’s. The Canaanites
   and Perizzites
   were also living in the land
   at that time.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-13-8" id="en-NIV-327">

   So Abram said to Lot,
   “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me,
   or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.

   Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain
   of the Jordan toward Zoar
   was well watered, like the garden of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   like the land of Egypt.
   (This was before the

   and Gomorrah.)
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-13-11" id="en-NIV-330">

   So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:

   Abram lived in the land of Canaan,
