   When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan,
   the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   “Choose twelve men

   So Joshua called together the twelve men

   and said to them, “Go over before the ark of the

   Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,

   So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones

   according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the

    Lord

   The men of Reuben,
