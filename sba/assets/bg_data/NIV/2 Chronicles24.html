   Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.

   He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, “Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money
   due annually from all Israel,
   to repair the temple of your God. Do it now.” But the Levites
   did not act at once.

   Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, “Why haven’t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the

   Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king’s officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place.
