   Paul’s Defense of His Ministry

   By the humility and gentleness
   of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul,
   who am “timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” toward you when away!
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-2" id="en-NIV-28974">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold
   as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-3" id="en-NIV-28975">

   For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.

   The weapons we fight with
   are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power
   to demolish strongholds.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-5" id="en-NIV-28977">
   <sup class="versenum">

   We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God,
   and we take captive every thought to make it obedient
   to Christ.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-6" id="en-NIV-28978">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.

  <span class="text 2Cor-10-7" id="en-NIV-28979">

   You are judging by appearances.
   If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ,
   they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do.

  <span class="text 2Cor-10-8" id="en-NIV-28980">

   So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us
   for building you up rather than tearing you down,
   I will not be ashamed of it.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-9" id="en-NIV-28981">

   I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.

   For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive
   and his speaking amounts to nothing.”

  <span class="text 2Cor-10-11" id="en-NIV-28983">

   Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.

  <span class="text 2Cor-10-12" id="en-NIV-28984">

   We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves.
   When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.

  <span class="text 2Cor-10-13" id="en-NIV-28985">
   <sup class="versenum">

   We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us,
   a sphere that also includes you.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-14" id="en-NIV-28986">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you
   with the gospel of Christ.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-15" id="en-NIV-28987">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15

   Neither do we go beyond our limits
   by boasting of work done by others.
   Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow,
   our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-16" id="en-NIV-28988">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   so that we can preach the gospel
   in the regions beyond you.
   For we do not want to boast about work already done in someone else’s territory.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-10-17" id="en-NIV-28989">

   But, “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”

  <span class="text 2Cor-10-18" id="en-NIV-28990">

   For it is not the one who commends himself
   who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
