   Are we beginning to commend ourselves
   again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation
   to you or from you?

   You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone.

   You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God,
   not on tablets of stone
   but on tablets of human hearts.

   Not that we are competent in ourselves
   to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.

   He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant
   —not of the letter
   but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

   Now if the ministry that brought death,
   which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory,
   transitory though it was,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-3-8" id="en-NIV-28850">
   <sup class="versenum">

   will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?

  <span class="text 2Cor-3-9" id="en-NIV-28851">

   If the ministry that brought condemnation
   was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-3-10" id="en-NIV-28852">

   Therefore, since we have such a hope,

  <span class="text 2Cor-3-13" id="en-NIV-28855">

   We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face
   to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away.

  <span class="text 2Cor-3-14" id="en-NIV-28856">

   But their minds were made dull,
   for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant
   is read.
   It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.

  <span class="text 2Cor-3-15" id="en-NIV-28857">

   And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate
   the Lord’s glory,
   are being transformed into his image
   with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
