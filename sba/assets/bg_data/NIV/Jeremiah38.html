   Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur
   , Jehukal
   son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said,

   “This is what the

    Lord

   says: ‘Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague,
   but whoever goes over to the Babylonians
   will live. They will escape with their lives; they will live.’
  </span>
  <span class="text Jer-38-3" id="en-NIV-19899">

   And this is what the

   says: ‘This city will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.’”

   Then the officials
   said to the king, “This man should be put to death.
   He is discouraging
   the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.”

   “He is in your hands,”

   So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard.
   They lowered Jeremiah by ropes
   into the cistern; it had no water in it,
   only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.

   But Ebed-Melek,
   a Cushite,
   an official
   in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,

   Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him,

   <sup class="versenum">

   “My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern,
   where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread
   in the city.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Jer-38-10" id="en-NIV-19906">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Jer-38-11" id="en-NIV-19907">

   So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes
   to Jeremiah in the cistern.

  <span class="text Jer-38-12" id="en-NIV-19908">

   Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so,

   Then King Zedekiah sent
