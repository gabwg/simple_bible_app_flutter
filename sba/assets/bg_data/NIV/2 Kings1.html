   Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers,
   saying to them, “Go and consult Baal-Zebub,
   the god of Ekron,
   to see if I will recover
   from this injury.”

   said to Elijah
   the Tishbite, “Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel

   “A man came to meet us,” they replied. “And he said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, “This is what the

   Then he sent
   to Elijah a captain
