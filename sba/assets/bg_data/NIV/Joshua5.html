   Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast
   heard how the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until they
   had crossed over, their hearts melted in fear

   At that time the

   Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of military age
   —died in the wilderness on the way after leaving Egypt.

   All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not.

   The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness
   forty years
   until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.

   Then the

   said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So the place has been called Gilgal

   On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month,
   while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.

   The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land:
   unleavened bread
   and roasted grain.

   The manna stopped the day after

   Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man
