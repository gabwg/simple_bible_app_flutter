   The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin,
   which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.

   In the desert the whole community grumbled

   The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the

   ’s hand in Egypt!
   There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food
   we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.”

   Then the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven
   for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test
   them and see whether they will follow my instructions.
  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-16-5" id="en-NIV-1953">

   On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice

  <span class="text Exod-16-6" id="en-NIV-1954">

   So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   who brought you out of Egypt,

  </span>
  <span class="text Exod-16-8" id="en-NIV-1956">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Moses also said, “You will know that it was the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Exod-16-9" id="en-NIV-1957">

   Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the

   While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory
   of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   “I have heard the grumbling

   That evening quail

  <span class="text Exod-16-14" id="en-NIV-1962">

   When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost

   When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know

   Moses said to them, “It is the bread

   This is what the

   And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.
   Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.

   However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell.

  <span class="text Exod-16-21" id="en-NIV-1969">

   On the sixth day, they gathered twice
   as much—two omers

   He said to them, “This is what the
