   It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father’s wife.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-5-2" id="en-NIV-28457">

   And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have gone into mourning
   and have put out of your fellowship
   the man who has been doing this?
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-5-3" id="en-NIV-28458">

   For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit.
   As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus
   on the one who has been doing this.

  <span class="text 1Cor-5-4" id="en-NIV-28459">

   So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-5-5" id="en-NIV-28460">
   <sup class="versenum">

   hand this man over
   to Satan
   for the destruction of the flesh,
   so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.

   Your boasting is not good.
   Don’t you know that a little yeast
   leavens the whole batch of dough?
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-5-7" id="en-NIV-28462">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.

   Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread
   of sincerity and truth.

   I wrote to you in my letter not to associate
   with sexually immoral people—
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-5-10" id="en-NIV-28465">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   not at all meaning the people of this world
   who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-5-11" id="en-NIV-28466">
   <sup class="versenum">

   But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister
   but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater
   or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people.

   What business is it of mine to judge those outside
   the church? Are you not to judge those inside?
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-5-13" id="en-NIV-28468">
   <sup class="versenum">

   God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”
