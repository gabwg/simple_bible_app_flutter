   Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates
   we do not need to write to you,
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-5-2" id="en-NIV-29624">
   <sup class="versenum">

   for you know very well that the day of the Lord
   will come like a thief in the night.

   While people are saying, “Peace and safety,”
   destruction will come on them suddenly,
   as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Thess-5-4" id="en-NIV-29626">

   But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness
   so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-5-5" id="en-NIV-29627">

   You are all children of the light
   and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.

   So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep,
   but let us be awake
   and sober.

  <span class="text 1Thess-5-8" id="en-NIV-29630">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8

   But since we belong to the day,
   let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate,
   and the hope of salvation
   as a helmet.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Thess-5-9" id="en-NIV-29631">

   For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath
   but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
