   In the ninth year of Zedekiah
   king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar
   king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege
   to it.

   Then all the officials

   When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls,

   But the Babylonian

   sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard.
