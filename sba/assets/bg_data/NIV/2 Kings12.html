   In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash
   became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.

   The high places,

   Joash said to the priests, “Collect

   Therefore King Joash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them, “Why aren’t you repairing the damage done to the temple? Take no more money from your treasurers, but hand it over for repairing the temple.”

   Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the temple of the

   Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal secretary
