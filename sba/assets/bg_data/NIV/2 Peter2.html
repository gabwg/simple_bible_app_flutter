   But there were also false prophets
   among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you.
   They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord
   who bought them
   —bringing swift destruction on themselves.

   For if God did not spare angels when they sinned,
   but sent them to hell,
   putting them in chains of darkness
   to be held for judgment;

   if he did not spare the ancient world
   when he brought the flood on its ungodly people,

   if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes,

   if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials
