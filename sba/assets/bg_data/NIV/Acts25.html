   Three days after arriving in the province, Festus
   went up from Caesarea
   to Jerusalem,
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-25-2" id="en-NIV-27799">

   They requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.

  <span class="text Acts-25-4" id="en-NIV-27801">

   Festus answered, “Paul is being held
   at Caesarea,
   and I myself am going there soon.

  <span class="text Acts-25-5" id="en-NIV-27802">

   Let some of your leaders come with me, and if the man has done anything wrong, they can press charges against him there.”

   After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he convened the court
   and ordered that Paul be brought before him.

   When Paul came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. They brought many serious charges against him,
   but they could not prove them.

 <p>
  <span class="text Acts-25-8" id="en-NIV-27805">

   Then Paul made his defense: “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law or against the temple
   or against Caesar.”

   Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor,
   said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?”

 <p>
  <span class="text Acts-25-10" id="en-NIV-27807">

   Paul answered: “I am now standing before Caesar’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews,
   as you yourself know very well.

   If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”

   A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea

   Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul’s case with the king. He said: “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.

   When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him

   Instead, they had some points of dispute

   I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.

   The next day Agrippa and Bernice
   came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.

   I found he had done nothing deserving of death,
   but because he made his appeal to the Emperor
   I decided to send him to Rome.

   But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.
