   After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer

   When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen

   When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.”
