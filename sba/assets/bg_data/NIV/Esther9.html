   On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar,
   the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand
   over those who hated them.

   The Jews assembled in their cities
   in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those determined to destroy them. No one could stand against them,
   because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them.

   And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the king’s administrators helped the Jews,
   because fear of Mordecai had seized them.

   The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted.”

   “If it pleases the king,” Esther answered, “give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day’s edict tomorrow also, and let Haman’s ten sons

 <p>
  <span class="text Esth-9-14" id="en-NIV-12849">

   The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.

   Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief
   from their enemies.
   They killed seventy-five thousand of them

   Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far,
  </span>
  <span class="text Esth-9-21" id="en-NIV-12856">

   from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration.
   He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food

   But when the plot came to the king’s attention,

   These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, and in every province and in every city. And these days of Purim should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews—nor should the memory of these days die out among their descendants.
