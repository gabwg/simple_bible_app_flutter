   Now there was a famine in the land
   —besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines
   in Gerar.

   The

    Lord
   </span>
   appeared
   to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt;
   live in the land where I tell you to live.

   Stay in this land for a while,
   and I will be with you
   and will bless you.
   For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands
   and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-26-4" id="en-NIV-697">
   <sup class="versenum">

   I will make your descendants

   because Abraham obeyed me
   and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees
   and my instructions.

  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-26-6" id="en-NIV-699">

   So Isaac stayed in Gerar.

   When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,
   ” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.”
  </span>

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-26-8" id="en-NIV-701">

   When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines
   looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-26-9" id="en-NIV-702">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?
   ”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-26-9">
   Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.”

  <span class="text Gen-26-10" id="en-NIV-703">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us?
   One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-26-11" id="en-NIV-704">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms
   this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”

   Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold,
   because the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   blessed him.

  <span class="text Gen-26-13" id="en-NIV-706">

   The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.

  <span class="text Gen-26-14" id="en-NIV-707">

   He had so many flocks and herds and servants
   that the Philistines envied him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-26-15" id="en-NIV-708">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So all the wells
   that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up,
   filling them with earth.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-26-16" id="en-NIV-709">

   Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us;
   you have become too powerful for us.

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-26-17" id="en-NIV-710">
   <sup class="versenum">

   So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar,

   <sup class="versenum">

   Isaac reopened the wells
   that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.

 <p>
  <span class="text Gen-26-19" id="en-NIV-712">
   <sup class="versenum">

   Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-26-20" id="en-NIV-713">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20

   But the herders of Gerar quarreled
   with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!”
   So he named the well Esek,
   because they disputed with him.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gen-26-21" id="en-NIV-714">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21

   Then they dug another well, but they quarreled
   over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.

  <span class="text Gen-26-22" id="en-NIV-715">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth,
   saying, “Now the

   and we will flourish

   That night the

   appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham.

  <span class="text Gen-26-25" id="en-NIV-718">

   Isaac built an altar

   They answered, “We saw clearly that the
