   So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet,
  </span>
  <span class="text Esth-7-2" id="en-NIV-12810">

   and as they were drinking wine
   on the second day, the king again asked, “Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom,
   it will be granted.
   ”

 <p>
  <span class="text Esth-7-3" id="en-NIV-12811">

   Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor
   with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life—this is my petition. And spare my people—this is my request.

  <span class="text Esth-7-4" id="en-NIV-12812">

   For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated.
   If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.

   King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who is he? Where is he—the man who has dared to do such a thing?”

 <p>
  <span class="text Esth-7-6" id="en-NIV-12814">

   Esther said, “An adversary and enemy! This vile Haman!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Esth-7-6">
   Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.
  </span>
  <span class="text Esth-7-7" id="en-NIV-12815">

   The king got up in a rage,
   left his wine and went out into the palace garden.
   But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate,
   stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Esth-7-8" id="en-NIV-12816">

   Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch
   where Esther was reclining.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Esth-7-8">
   The king exclaimed, “Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Esth-7-8">
   As soon as the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.

   Then Harbona,
   one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, “A pole reaching to a height of fifty cubits
   stands by Haman’s house. He had it set up for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Esth-7-9">
   The king said, “Impale him on it!”
  </span>
  <span class="text Esth-7-10" id="en-NIV-12818">

   So they impaled
   Haman
   on the pole
   he had set up for Mordecai.
   Then the king’s fury subsided.
