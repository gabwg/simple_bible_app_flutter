   Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene
   went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.

   So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved,
   and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!”

  <span class="text John-20-3" id="en-NIV-26871">

   Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first,
