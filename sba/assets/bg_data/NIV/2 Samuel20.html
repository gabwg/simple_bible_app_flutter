   When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines
   he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them but had no sexual relations with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows.

   While they were at the great rock in Gibeon,

   Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt
