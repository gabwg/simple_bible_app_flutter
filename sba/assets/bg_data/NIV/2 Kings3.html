   Joram
   son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.

   Nevertheless he clung to the sins

   Now Mesha king of Moab
   raised sheep, and he had to pay the king of Israel a tribute of a hundred thousand lambs
   and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
