   Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened

   As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons
   are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day.

   Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey
   have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe
   to make me shut my eyes? If I have done
   any of these things, I will make it right.”
