   Concerning Food Sacrificed to Idols

   Now about food sacrificed to idols:
   We know that “We all possess knowledge.”
   But knowledge puffs up while love builds up.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-2" id="en-NIV-28530">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Those who think they know something
   do not yet know as they ought to know.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-3" id="en-NIV-28531">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   But whoever loves God is known by God.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-4" id="en-NIV-28532">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols:
   We know that “An idol is nothing at all in the world”
   and that “There is no God but one.”
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-5" id="en-NIV-28533">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   For even if there are so-called gods,
   whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”),
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-6" id="en-NIV-28534">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   yet for us there is but one God,
   the Father,
   from whom all things came
   and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord,
   Jesus Christ, through whom all things came
   and through whom we live.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-7" id="en-NIV-28535">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   But not everyone possesses this knowledge.
   Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak,
   it is defiled.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-8" id="en-NIV-28536">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   But food does not bring us near to God;
   we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-9" id="en-NIV-28537">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block
   to the weak.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-10" id="en-NIV-28538">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols?
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-11" id="en-NIV-28539">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed
   by your knowledge.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-12" id="en-NIV-28540">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   When you sin against them
   in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-8-13" id="en-NIV-28541">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.
