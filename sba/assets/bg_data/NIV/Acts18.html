   After this, Paul left Athens
   and went to Corinth.

   There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla,
   because Claudius
   had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,
  </span>
  <span class="text Acts-18-3" id="en-NIV-27561">

   and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.

   Every Sabbath
   he reasoned in the synagogue,

   When Silas
   and Timothy
   came from Macedonia,
   Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.

   But when they opposed Paul and became abusive,
   he shook out his clothes in protest
   and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads!
   I am innocent of it.
   From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”

   Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God.

   Crispus,
   the synagogue leader,
   and his entire household
   believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.

   One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision:

    “Do not be afraid;

   While Gallio was proconsul

   the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment.

   Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, “If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.

   Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters
   and sailed for Syria,
   accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.
   Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae
   because of a vow he had taken.

   After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia

   Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos,
