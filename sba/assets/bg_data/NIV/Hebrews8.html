   Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest,
   who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
  </span>
  <span class="text Heb-8-2" id="en-NIV-30095">

   and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle
   set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.

   Every high priest
   is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices,
   and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.

   If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.

   They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy
   and shadow
   of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned
   when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”

   But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant
   of which he is mediator
   is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.
