   Now Adoni-Zedek
   king of Jerusalem
   heard that Joshua had taken Ai
   and totally destroyed
   it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon
   had made a treaty of peace
   with Israel and had become their allies.

  <span class="text Josh-10-2" id="en-NIV-6067">

   He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.

  <span class="text Josh-10-3" id="en-NIV-6068">

   So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron,
   Piram king of Jarmuth,
   Japhia king of Lachish
   and Debir
   king of Eglon.

   “Come up and help me attack Gibeon,” he said, “because it has made peace

   Then the five kings
   of the Amorites
   —the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon—joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.

   The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal:
   “Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.”

 <p>
  <span class="text Josh-10-7" id="en-NIV-6072">

   Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon
