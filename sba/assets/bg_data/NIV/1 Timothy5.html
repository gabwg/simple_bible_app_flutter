   Do not rebuke an older man

   But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents,
   for this is pleasing to God.

   The widow who is really in need

   Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied
   the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

   No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband,

   and is well known for her good deeds,
   such as bringing up children, showing hospitality,
   washing the feet
   of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble
   and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.

   As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.

   Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge.

   Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies
   who talk nonsense,
   saying things they ought not to.

   to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.

   If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.

   The elders
   who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor,
