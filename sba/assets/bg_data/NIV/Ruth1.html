   In the days when the judges ruled,
   there was a famine in the land.
   So a man from Bethlehem in Judah,
   together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while
   in the country of Moab.

   The man’s name was Elimelek,
   his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion.
   They were Ephrathites
   from Bethlehem,
   Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.

   Now Elimelek, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.

   They married Moabite women,
   one named Orpah and the other Ruth.
   After they had lived there about ten years,

   When Naomi heard in Moab
   that the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   had come to the aid of his people
   by providing food
   for them, she and her daughters-in-law

  <span class="text Ruth-1-7" id="en-NIV-7135">

   With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.

   Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s home.
   May the

 <p>

   Then she kissed

   But Naomi said, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?

  <span class="text Ruth-1-12" id="en-NIV-7140">

   Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons—

   would you wait until they grew up?
   Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter
   for me than for you, because the

   At this they wept

   “Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law

   But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you
   or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go,

   and your God my God.

   So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem.
   When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred

   “Don’t call me Naomi,

   So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite,

   arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest
   was beginning.
