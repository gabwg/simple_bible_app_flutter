   Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne
   a scroll with writing on both sides
   and sealed
   with seven seals.

   And I saw a mighty angel
   proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?”

   Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion
   of the tribe of Judah,
   the Root of David,
   has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”

   Then I saw a Lamb,
   looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures
   and the elders.
   The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes,
   which are the seven spirits
   of God sent out into all the earth.

   And when he had taken it, the four living creatures
   and the twenty-four elders
   fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp
   and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers
   of God’s people.
