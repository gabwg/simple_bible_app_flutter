   This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about

   Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet

   But after he had considered this, an angel
   of the Lord appeared to him in a dream
   and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

  <span class="text Matt-1-21" id="en-NIV-23166">

   All this took place to fulfill

  <span class="text Matt-1-24" id="en-NIV-23169">

   When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel

   But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
