   If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord’s people?
  </span>
  <span class="text 1Cor-6-2" id="en-NIV-28470">

   Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world?
   And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?

   Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!

   Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church?

   I say this to shame you.
   Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?

   The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?

  <span class="text 1Cor-6-8" id="en-NIV-28476">

   Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters.

   Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God?
   Do not be deceived:
   Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers
   nor men who have sex with men

  <span class="text 1Cor-6-10" id="en-NIV-28478">

   And that is what some of you were.
   But you were washed,
   you were sanctified,
   you were justified
   in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

   “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial.
   “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything.

   You say, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.”
   The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord,
   and the Lord for the body.

   Flee from sexual immorality.
   All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.
