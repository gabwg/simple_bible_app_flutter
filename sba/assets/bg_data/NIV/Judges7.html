   Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal
   (that is, Gideon
   ) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod.
   The camp of Midian
   was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.

   The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Gideon, “You have too many men. I cannot deliver Midian into their hands, or Israel would boast against me, ‘My own strength
   has saved me.’

   Now announce to the army, ‘Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.
   ’” So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.

   But the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Gideon, “There are still too many
   men. Take them down to the water, and I will thin them out for you there. If I say, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go; but if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”

   So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   told him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-7-6" id="en-NIV-6701">

   Three hundred of them
   drank from cupped hands, lapping like dogs. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.

   The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands.
   Let all the others go home.”

  <span class="text Judg-7-8" id="en-NIV-6703">

   So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others.

 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-7-8">
   Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.

   During that night the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   said to Gideon, “Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.

   If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-7-11" id="en-NIV-6706">
   <sup class="versenum">

   and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.” So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.

   The Midianites, the Amalekites
   and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts.
   Their camels
   could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.

   Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. “I had a dream,” he was saying. “A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-7-14" id="en-NIV-6709">
   <sup class="versenum">

   His friend responded, “This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash,
   the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Judg-7-15" id="en-NIV-6710">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15

   When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped.
   He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, “Get up! The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has given the Midianite camp into your hands.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Judg-7-16" id="en-NIV-6711">

   Dividing the three hundred men
   into three companies,
   he placed trumpets
   and empty jars
   in the hands of all of them, with torches
   inside.

   “Watch me,” he told them. “Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.

   When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets,

   Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars
   that were in their hands.

   The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches
   in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, “A sword
   for the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.

   When the three hundred trumpets sounded,
   the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">

   caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other
   with their swords.
   The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah
   near Tabbath.

   Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan

   They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb
   . They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb,
   and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites
   and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.
