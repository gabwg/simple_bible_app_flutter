   In the time of Herod king of Judea
   there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah;
   his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
  </span>

   Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commands and decrees blamelessly.
  </span>
  <span class="text Luke-1-7" id="en-NIV-24901">

   Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
  </span>
  <span class="text Luke-1-9" id="en-NIV-24903">
   <sup class="versenum">

   he was chosen by lot,
   according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
  </span>
  <span class="text Luke-1-10" id="en-NIV-24904">
   <sup class="versenum">

  <span class="text Luke-1-11" id="en-NIV-24905">

  <span class="text Luke-1-12" id="en-NIV-24906">
   <sup class="versenum">

  </span>
  <span class="text Luke-1-13" id="en-NIV-24907">
   <sup class="versenum">
