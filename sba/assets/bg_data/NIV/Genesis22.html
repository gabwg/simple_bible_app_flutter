   Then God said, “Take your son

   Early the next morning
   Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.

   Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac,

   Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?”

   When they reached the place God had told him about,

   Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram
