   One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi
   said to her, “My daughter, I must find a home
   for you, where you will be well provided for.

   Now Boaz, with whose women you have worked, is a relative
   of ours. Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.

   put on perfume,
   and get dressed in your best clothes.
   Then go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.

   When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.”

   “I will do whatever you say,”

   So she went down to the threshing floor

   When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits,
   he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile.
   Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down.

   “The

   And now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character.

   Although it is true that I am a guardian-redeemer of our family,

   Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to do his duty as your guardian-redeemer,

   So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor.

   He also said, “Bring me the shawl
