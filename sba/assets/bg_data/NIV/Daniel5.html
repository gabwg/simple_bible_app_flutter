   King Belshazzar

   While Belshazzar was drinking

   The king summoned the enchanters,

   There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods
   in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom

   Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners.

   He did this because Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar,

   Because of the high position he gave him, all the nations and peoples of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death;
