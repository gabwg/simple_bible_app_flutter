   You foolish
   Galatians!
   Who has bewitched you?
   Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-2" id="en-NIV-29105">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit
   by the works of the law,
   or by believing what you heard?
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-3" id="en-NIV-29106">
   <sup class="versenum">
    3
   </sup>
   Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-4" id="en-NIV-29107">
   <sup class="versenum">
    4
   </sup>
   Have you experienced
   so much in vain—if it really was in vain?
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-5" id="en-NIV-29108">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles
   among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-6" id="en-NIV-29109">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gal-3-7" id="en-NIV-29110">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   Understand, then, that those who have faith
   are children of Abraham.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-8" id="en-NIV-29111">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-9" id="en-NIV-29112">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   So those who rely on faith
   are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gal-3-10" id="en-NIV-29113">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   For all who rely on the works of the law
   are under a curse,
   as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-11" id="en-NIV-29114">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God,
   because “the righteous will live by faith.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-12" id="en-NIV-29115">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-13" id="en-NIV-29116">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
   by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-14" id="en-NIV-29117">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus,
   so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.

 <h3>
  <span class="text Gal-3-15" id="en-NIV-29118">
   The Law and the Promise
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gal-3-15">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   Brothers and sisters,
   let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-16" id="en-NIV-29119">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed.
   Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,”
   meaning one person, who is Christ.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-17" id="en-NIV-29120">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years
   later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-18" id="en-NIV-29121">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18
   </sup>
   For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise;
   but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gal-3-19" id="en-NIV-29122">
   <sup class="versenum">
    19
   </sup>
   Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions
   until the Seed
   to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels
   and entrusted to a mediator.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-20" id="en-NIV-29123">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   A mediator,
   however, implies more than one party; but God is one.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gal-3-21" id="en-NIV-29124">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21
   </sup>
   Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not!
   For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-22" id="en-NIV-29125">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22
   </sup>
   But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin,
   so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="text Gal-3-23" id="en-NIV-29126">
   Children of God
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gal-3-23">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23
   </sup>
   Before the coming of this faith,
   we were held in custody
   under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-24" id="en-NIV-29127">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24
   </sup>
   So the law was our guardian until Christ came
   that we might be justified by faith.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-25" id="en-NIV-29128">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25
   </sup>
   Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Gal-3-26" id="en-NIV-29129">
   <sup class="versenum">
    26
   </sup>
   So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God
   through faith,
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-27" id="en-NIV-29130">
   <sup class="versenum">
    27
   </sup>
   for all of you who were baptized into Christ
   have clothed yourselves with Christ.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-28" id="en-NIV-29131">
   <sup class="versenum">
    28
   </sup>
   There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free,
   nor is there male and female,
   for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
  </span>
  <span class="text Gal-3-29" id="en-NIV-29132">
   <sup class="versenum">
    29

   If you belong to Christ,
   then you are Abraham’s seed,
   and heirs
   according to the promise.
