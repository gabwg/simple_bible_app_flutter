   Now listen,
   you rich people,
   weep and wail

   Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days.

   Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers
   who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries

   Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming.
   See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting
   for the autumn and spring rains.

   Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets

   As you know, we count as blessed
   those who have persevered. You have heard of Job’s perseverance

   The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.

   Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple “Yes” or “No.” Otherwise you will be condemned.

   Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray.

   Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders

   Elijah was a human being, even as we are.
