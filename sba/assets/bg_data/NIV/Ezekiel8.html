   In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders
   of Judah were sitting before
   me, the hand of the Sovereign
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   came on me there.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-2" id="en-NIV-20607">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man.
   From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-3" id="en-NIV-20608">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   He stretched out what looked like a hand
   and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up
   between earth and heaven and in visions
   of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court,
   where the idol that provokes to jealousy
   stood.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-4" id="en-NIV-20609">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   And there before me was the glory
   of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-5" id="en-NIV-20610">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   Then he said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol
   of jealousy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-6" id="en-NIV-20611">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly detestable
   things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary?
   But you will see things that are even more detestable.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-7" id="en-NIV-20612">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-8" id="en-NIV-20613">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-9" id="en-NIV-20614">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.”
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-10" id="en-NIV-20615">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls
   all kinds of crawling things and unclean
   animals and all the idols of Israel.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-11" id="en-NIV-20616">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   In front of them stood seventy elders
   of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer
   in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense
   was rising.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-12" id="en-NIV-20617">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness,
   each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, ‘The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   does not see
   us; the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   has forsaken the land.’”
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-13" id="en-NIV-20618">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   Again, he said, “You will see them doing things that are even more detestable.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-14" id="en-NIV-20619">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz.
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-15" id="en-NIV-20620">
   <sup class="versenum">
    15
   </sup>
   He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-16" id="en-NIV-20621">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   He then brought me into the inner court
   of the house of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   , and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar,
   were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun
   in the east.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-17" id="en-NIV-20622">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things
   they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence
   and continually arouse my anger?
   Look at them putting the branch to their nose!
  </span>
  <span class="text Ezek-8-18" id="en-NIV-20623">
   <sup class="versenum">
    18
   </sup>
   Therefore I will deal with them in anger;
   I will not look on them with pity
   or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen
   to them.”
