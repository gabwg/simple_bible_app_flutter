   Abimelek

   When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelek, for they said, “He is related to us.”

   They gave him seventy shekels

   He went to his father’s home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers,
   the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham,

   God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal’s seventy sons,

   After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden

   Then Gaal son of Ebed

   Abimelek and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance of the city gate. Then two companies attacked those in the fields and struck them down.

   he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon.

   So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire with the people still inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died.

   Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women—all the people of the city—had fled. They had locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof.

   a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull.
