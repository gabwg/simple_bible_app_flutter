   When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children,

   During wheat harvest,
   Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants,

   That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs,

   Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond

   Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals
