   At Iconium
   Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue.
   There they spoke so effectively that a great number
   of Jews and Greeks believed.

   But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.

   So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly
   for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders.

   The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.

   There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews,

   But they found out about it and fled
   to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country,

   In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth

   He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed

  <span class="text Acts-14-10" id="en-NIV-27425">

   When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”

   Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.

   The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.

   But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes
   and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:

   “Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human,
   like you. We are bringing you good news,
   telling you to turn from these worthless things
   to the living God,
   who made the heavens and the earth
   and the sea and everything in them.

   Yet he has not left himself without testimony:
   He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons;
   he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.”

   Then some Jews
