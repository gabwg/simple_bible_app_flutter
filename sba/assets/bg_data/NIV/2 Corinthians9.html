   There is no need
   for me to write to you about this service
   to the Lord’s people.

   For I know your eagerness to help,
   and I have been boasting
   about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year
   you in Achaia
   were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.

   But I am sending the brothers
   in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be.

   For if any Macedonians
   come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to say anything about you—would be ashamed of having been so confident.

   So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers
   to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift,
   not as one grudgingly given.
