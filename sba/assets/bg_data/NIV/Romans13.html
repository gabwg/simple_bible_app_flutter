   Submission to Governing Authorities

   Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities,
   for there is no authority except that which God has established.
   The authorities that exist have been established by God.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-13-2" id="en-NIV-28269">

   Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted,
   and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.

   For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-13-4" id="en-NIV-28271">

   For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
  </span>
  <span class="text Rom-13-5" id="en-NIV-28272">

   Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

   This is also why you pay taxes,
   for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing.

   Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes;
   if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

   Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law.

   The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,”
   and whatever other command there may be, are summed up
   in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”

  <span class="text Rom-13-10" id="en-NIV-28277">

   Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.

   The night is nearly over; the day is almost here.

   Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ,
