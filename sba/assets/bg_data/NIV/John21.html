   Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples,
   by the Sea of Galilee.
   It happened this way:
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-2" id="en-NIV-26901">
   <sup class="versenum">
    2
   </sup>
   Simon Peter, Thomas
   (also known as Didymus
   ), Nathanael
   from Cana in Galilee,
   the sons of Zebedee,
   and two other disciples were together.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-3" id="en-NIV-26902">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   “I’m going out to fish,” Simon Peter told them, and they said, “We’ll go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-4" id="en-NIV-26903">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-5" id="en-NIV-26904">
   <sup class="versenum">
    5
   </sup>
   He called out to them,
   <span class="woj">
    “Friends, haven’t you any fish?”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-5">
   “No,” they answered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-6" id="en-NIV-26905">
   <sup class="versenum">
    6
   </sup>
   He said,
   <span class="woj">
    “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.”
   </span>
   When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-7" id="en-NIV-26906">
   <sup class="versenum">
    7
   </sup>
   Then the disciple whom Jesus loved
   said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, “It is the Lord,” he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-8" id="en-NIV-26907">
   <sup class="versenum">
    8
   </sup>
   The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-9" id="en-NIV-26908">
   <sup class="versenum">
    9
   </sup>
   When they landed, they saw a fire
   of burning coals there with fish on it,
   and some bread.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-10" id="en-NIV-26909">
   <sup class="versenum">
    10
   </sup>
   Jesus said to them,
   <span class="woj">
    “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-11" id="en-NIV-26910">
   <sup class="versenum">
    11
   </sup>
   So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-12" id="en-NIV-26911">
   <sup class="versenum">
    12
   </sup>
   Jesus said to them,
   <span class="woj">
    “Come and have breakfast.”
   </span>
   None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-13" id="en-NIV-26912">
   <sup class="versenum">
    13
   </sup>
   Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-14" id="en-NIV-26913">
   <sup class="versenum">
    14
   </sup>
   This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples
   after he was raised from the dead.

 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-15">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter,
   <span class="woj">
    “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-15">
   “Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I love you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-15">
   Jesus said,
   <span class="woj">
    “Feed my lambs.”

 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-16" id="en-NIV-26915">
   <sup class="versenum">
    16
   </sup>
   Again Jesus said,
   <span class="woj">
    “Simon son of John, do you love me?”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-16">
   He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-16">
   Jesus said,
   <span class="woj">
    “Take care of my sheep.”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-17" id="en-NIV-26916">
   <sup class="versenum">
    17
   </sup>
   The third time he said to him,
   <span class="woj">
    “Simon son of John, do you love me?”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-17">
   Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time,
   <span class="woj">
    “Do you love me?”
   </span>
   He said, “Lord, you know all things;
   you know that I love you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-17">
   Jesus said,
   <span class="woj">
    “Feed my sheep.
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-18" id="en-NIV-26917">

    Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.”

  <span class="text John-21-19" id="en-NIV-26918">
   <sup class="versenum">

   </sup>
   Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death
   by which Peter would glorify God.
   Then he said to him,
   <span class="woj">
    “Follow me!”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-20" id="en-NIV-26919">
   <sup class="versenum">
    20
   </sup>
   Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved
   was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”)
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-21" id="en-NIV-26920">
   <sup class="versenum">
    21
   </sup>
   When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-22" id="en-NIV-26921">
   <sup class="versenum">
    22
   </sup>
   Jesus answered,
   <span class="woj">
    “If I want him to remain alive until I return,
    what is that to you? You must follow me.”
   </span>
  </span>
  <span class="text John-21-23" id="en-NIV-26922">
   <sup class="versenum">
    23
   </sup>
   Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers
   that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said,
   <span class="woj">
    “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?”
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-24" id="en-NIV-26923">
   <sup class="versenum">
    24
   </sup>
   This is the disciple who testifies to these things
   and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text John-21-25" id="en-NIV-26924">
   <sup class="versenum">
    25
   </sup>
   Jesus did many other things as well.
   If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
