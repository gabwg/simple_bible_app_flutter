   After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open
   in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet
   said,
   <span class="woj">
    “Come up here,
    and I will show you what must take place after this.”

   At once I was in the Spirit,
   and there before me was a throne in heaven
   with someone sitting on it.

   And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper
   and ruby.
   A rainbow
   that shone like an emerald
   encircled the throne.

   Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders.
   They were dressed in white

   From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder.
   In front of the throne, seven lamps
   were blazing. These are the seven spirits
   of God.

   In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures,

   The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.

   Each of the four living creatures
