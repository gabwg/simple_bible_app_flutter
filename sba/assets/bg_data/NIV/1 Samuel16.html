   The

   said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn
   for Saul, since I have rejected
   him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil
   and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse
   of Bethlehem. I have chosen
   one of his sons to be king.”

   The

   Samuel did what the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   said. When he arrived at Bethlehem,
   the elders of the town trembled
   when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in peace?

 <p>
  <span class="text 1Sam-16-5" id="en-NIV-7601">

   Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   . Consecrate
   yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.

   When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab

   But the

   said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord
   </span>
   does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance,
   but the

    Lord

   looks at the heart.”

   Then Jesse called Abinadab
   and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The
   <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">
    Lord

   has not chosen this one either.”

   Jesse then had Shammah

   chosen this one.”

  <span class="text 1Sam-16-10" id="en-NIV-7606">

   Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The

  <span class="text 1Sam-16-11" id="en-NIV-7607">

  <span class="text 1Sam-16-11">
   “There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.”

   So he
   sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome

  <span class="text 1Sam-16-12">
   Then the

   So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed
   him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the

   Samuel then went to Ramah.

   Now the Spirit of the

   One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse

   He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the

   Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit
