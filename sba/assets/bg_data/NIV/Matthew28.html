   After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene
   and the other Mary
   went to look at the tomb.
  </span>

   There was a violent earthquake,
   for an angel
   of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone
   and sat on it.
  </span>
  <span class="text Matt-28-3" id="en-NIV-24199">

   His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.

   The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

   The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid,
   for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.

   He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.
   Come and see the place where he lay.

   Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee.
   There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”

   So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

   Suddenly Jesus met them.
   <span class="woj">
    “Greetings,”

   he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.

   While the women were on their way, some of the guards
   went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.

   When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
