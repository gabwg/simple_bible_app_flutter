   This will be my third visit to you.
   “Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.”

   I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent:
   On my return I will not spare
   those who sinned earlier
   or any of the others,
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-13-3" id="en-NIV-29047">
   <sup class="versenum">

   since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me.
   He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.

  <span class="text 2Cor-13-4" id="en-NIV-29048">

   For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness,
   yet he lives by God’s power.
   Likewise, we are weak
   in him, yet by God’s power we will live with him
   in our dealing with you.

   Examine yourselves
   to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.
   Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you
   —unless, of course, you fail the test?
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-13-6" id="en-NIV-29050">
   <sup class="versenum">

   And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.

   Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.
  </span>
  <span class="text 2Cor-13-8" id="en-NIV-29052">

   For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.

   We are glad whenever we are weak
   but you are strong;
   and our prayer is that you may be fully restored.

   This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh
   in my use of authority—the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.
