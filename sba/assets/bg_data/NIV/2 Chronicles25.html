   Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.

   Yet he did not put their children to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses,
   where the

   Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered
   those twenty years old
   or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men fit for military service,
   able to handle the spear and shield.

   Amaziah asked the man of God, “But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?”

   The man of God replied, “The

   Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir.

   Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided towns belonging to Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.

   When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods,

   The anger of the

   their own people from your hand?”

   After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash

   Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might deliver them into the hands of Jehoash, because they sought the gods of Edom.
