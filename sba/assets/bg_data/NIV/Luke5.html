   One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret,
   the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God.

   He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.
  </span>
  <span class="text Luke-5-3" id="en-NIV-25111">
   <sup class="versenum">

   He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.

   When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,
   <span class="woj">
    “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Luke-5-5" id="en-NIV-25113">

   Simon answered, “Master,
   we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything.
   But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Luke-5-6" id="en-NIV-25114">

   When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.

  <span class="text Luke-5-7" id="en-NIV-25115">

   So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.

   Then Jesus said to Simon,

   While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy.
