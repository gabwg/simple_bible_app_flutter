   Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb,
   standing on Mount Zion,
   and with him 144,000
   who had his name and his Father’s name
   written on their foreheads.

   And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters
   and like a loud peal of thunder.
   The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.

   And they sang a new song
   before the throne and before the four living creatures
   and the elders.
   No one could learn the song except the 144,000
   who had been redeemed from the earth.

   These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins.
   They follow the Lamb wherever he goes.
   They were purchased from among mankind
   and offered as firstfruits
   to God and the Lamb.

   Then I saw another angel flying in midair,

   they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury,
   which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath.
